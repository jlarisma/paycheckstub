																				<p>We've been asked many times, why do you have a company that makes Novelty Pay stubs,   who in their right minds wants them,  who are your customers?   With all these questions, ultimately, they demand give me a reason why anyone would want to have a Novelty pay stub,   To that, I say I can give you 10 reasons for a pay stub.</p>
<ol>
<li>You left a company a while ago on bad terms, and they don't return your requests for proof of past employment</li>
<li>The company that you worked for went bankrupt, and there is no one to contact, since there is no company</li>
<li>You don't want your friends to know how much you make, because they will ask you for $$</li>
<li>We've had numerous request for props in Movies and Educational material</li>
<li>You want to verify that your current job is taking the proper deductions so you want to compare</li>
<li>You lost or misplaced your current pay stub and you don't want to go into office to get a new one</li>
<li>You want to impress a potential girlfriend, so you leave a fat pay stub laying around the house to let her find it</li>
<li>Your parents bug you about getting a job, but, you don't really have one</li>
<li>Privacy, you don't want people knowing where you work, like location, type of business etc.</li>
<li>Create your dream pay stub, and use it as motivation, and positive reinforcing energy by looking at it daily</li>
</ol>

						<h2 class="et_pt_title"><a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/paper-use-paycheck-stub/">What paper to use for paycheck stub</a></h2>

						<p class="et_pt_blogmeta">Posted by <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/author/george-strnadgmail-com/" title="Posts by George Strnad" rel="author">George Strnad</a> on Dec 10, 2015 in <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/category/how-to-make-a-pay-stub-2/" rel="category tag">How to Make a pay Stub</a>, <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/category/pay-check-stubs/" rel="category tag">Pay Check Stubs</a>, <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/category/uncategorized/" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> | <span>Comments Off<span class="screen-reader-text"> on What paper to use for paycheck stub</span></span></p>

						
						
																				<p>I've been asked this question quite a few times,  "What paper to use for paycheck stub?", when trying to create paystubs.   Well..  I have two answers, an easy quick answer,  and I have a longer description answer if you want to know the detailed reasons,  I know you're busy, so, I give 2 options.</p>
<p>So, the quick answer to What paper to use for paycheck stub is....   any blank white paper that you would use in your own home.  Seriously.   If that's all you need, then go ahead, and print now..   If you want to know why, continue reading.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>First,</h2>
<p>we used to print on "Security Paper", and ship these to the customer, and, we might bring that service back if we get more requests for this also,  but,  in truth, we see less and less of this in the work environment.   More and more, employers are using Direct Deposit for the purposes of actual payment to their employees, and then they mail a receipt of a payment to the employee, which we all refer to as a paystub, or paycheck stub.     That piece of paper is only used as a reciept, for whatever reason, and most people don't need it usually, unless they want a loan or apartment, or show off to their girlfriends.  🙂</p>
<p>This has lead to online access for most employers,  big companies, have their own, like Best Buy Paystubs, or NYC Metro paystubs, but, small companies, who don't build their own websites, use outside services, and create an account on a payroll website, that they give access to their employees on.</p>
<p>An example, let's say you work for ABC Trucking.    They may or may not have a website, but, the trucker is on the road, and doesn't come in to any "office".  They just drive the truck, go home, and get paid.  they get paid if they are at home, or on the road,  so, it doesn't make sense to go into an office.   They probably go to  something like   "payroll.ABCTrucking.com" or something like it and there, they have to enter their Username and Password.  Then they can see their "<a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com" target="_blank">payroll advice</a>" which isn't advice, it's just info.</p>
<p>They can download their w2's  or they can get their total for the year, or they can print the last few paystubs, for their own reason, <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/proof-of-employment/" target="_blank">usually for proof of employment</a></p>
<p>This "trucker" in our example, will print this out at a Kinko's, or a Library, or their own home or home office.   Or, even if they go into the TRUCKING office, and they ask for their stubs, the secretary will print this out for them, on regular paper..</p>
<h2>Secondly,</h2>
<p>the paper to use for paycheck stub that we call security paper is intended for security issues of copying from employees.  Since this website is designed for low volume users, I'm assuming that you don't have security issues with yourself or your employees.   All security issues reside in the check that is submitted to your bank, and creating a paystub is only for the purposes of verification.    Security paper also had an actual check attached to it.  So, it needed to have a back where you could leave your name and sign it and put an account number on it, so the clerk would know which account to deposit it in.</p>
<p>Since we are not making checks here, just Check Stubs, you would have a normal piece of paper, from home or a library, or an office, that you printed a computer generated file on.</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense.   It's truly simple, and easy.</p>

						<p class="et_pt_blogmeta">Posted by <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/author/shawn/" title="Posts by shawn dumouchele" rel="author">shawn dumouchele</a> on Apr 12, 2015 in <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/category/proof-of-employment/" rel="category tag">Proof Of Employment</a> | <span>Comments Off<span class="screen-reader-text"> on Job Verification services</span></span></p>

						
						
																				<p>    Having a job says a lot about a person, and they type of job says even more.    Meeting someone initially as a stranger,  we tend to try and figure out what kind of person they are.    We do this in many ways, including how they approach us, and how they hold themselves.   Then, we ask them about themselves, and find out who they are.    This is fine for an interpersonal relationship, but, in a job interview,  or financial transaction,  we need to verify and confirm what the person is saying is true.    This is why <a href="http://www.iverifyme.com">we provide Job Verification Services</a> to our clients.    As of course the entity that will be lending money, or giving access to a home, or anything of value, will want to confirm you will have the means to pay.    Not to mention,  have a job.   We trust, and confirm,  and we allow you to do this via our Job Verification Services.<div id="attachment_1424" style="width: 218px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Job_verification.jpg"><img src="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Job_verification.jpg" alt="Proof of empolyment" width="208" height="243" class="size-full wp-image-1424" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Job Verification</p></div></p>
<p>  We provide this service for Companies and individuals.     Companies need our services to answer the needs of their employees, without having to respond to every job verification request or proof of income.   Imagine if a company has 50 employees, and 10 of them are applying for a car loan.   But, they are shopping around for great rates, or specific cars, each person will go to 5 dealerships or bank researching what kind of financing and rates they can get.    So this means there would be 50 communications from outside companies to the owner of this small company, or to the accounting office.   Which would have to be followed up by emails, or fax’s.  and verifications.   That’s a lot of work.</p>
<p>  Another reason for independent Job Verification Services is privacy.   What if you make a lot of money, and you don’t want your coworkers knowing how much you make.     Or you don’t want them to know you’re buying a nice car, or a second home.    Or you don’t want them knowing where you live.    If you have a person in accounting that is stalking you,  or you don’t make enough, and you have to go to lower level housing,  you still don’t want people knowing your off work business.    </p>
<p>  Speaking of privacy, what if you do a job that you don’t want people to know.   All things need employees, but, unfortunately, society judges people wrongly.    If you are a janitor,  or you work at some burger joint ,  or if you are an Escort,  or A stripper.    You don’t want everyone to know your business, and use it against you.</p>
<p>   <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/pay-stub-generator/" title="Pay Stub Generator">Click here for Proof of income</a> is similar to Job Verification but not the same.    You should know what you are trying to do, and what would be expected of your documents.     Proof of employment is also Job Verification, that is the same.   Proof of Income is something we provide.</p>

																				<p>Everyday, we see more reasons to have a pay stub.   As mentioned in our <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/whoneedsproofofincome/" title="Who needs Proof of Income or Employment">previous pay stub articles</a>,  in this economic system, everyone needs a Pay Stub to basically survive.   We mentioned you need this form of proof of income to get a car, or to get an apartment, or some form of credit.   But,  it seems there are many other reasons someone would need a proof of income.<div id="attachment_1416" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/reasons_for_pay_stub-e1426966209795.jpg"><img src="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/reasons_for_pay_stub-e1426966209795-300x210.jpg" alt="Reasons for Pay Stub" width="300" height="210" class="size-medium wp-image-1416" srcset="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/reasons_for_pay_stub-e1426966209795-300x210.jpg 300w, http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/reasons_for_pay_stub-e1426966209795.jpg 528w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">many reasons for Proof of Income or Pay Stub</p></div></p>
<p>There have been many instances where people need proof of income for some form of assistance.   For example,  Some perishes need either a utility bill or pay stub so they can get donations for helping them with an electric bill.</p>
<p>Some parents need a proof of income to get residency status to get their kids in school near their home.   If you work at home, or have a small business where you are the only employee,  you need a paystub.   But, do you need to spend the time and money to create that stub?   Especially if you are genuinely making the money,  and you try and create one, just for proof, and then someone calls you out on it.   There is a lot of explaining to do,  why not just <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/illinois-pay-stub-generator/" title="Illinois pay stub generator">let us create the pay stub for you</a>.</p>
<p>Another great example of where someone would need a pay stub, is when getting grants, like in Arenac County, in Michigan, which got $300,000  of grants to replace windows and other items for homes.   You simply needed to have a proof of income.   And if you work for a big company, that is not a problem, but, if you do odd jobs,  or part time work, or do your own business, then it's quite difficult to get your own pay stub.   </p>
<p>We agree, that it is silly to go by pay stubs, but as we continue to show, there is many more reasons to have a pay stub, it's the system we work in.  If you are a capable person, who is obviously making a living, but, simply don't have the paystub,  then use our service, be honest, and live a better life.</p>

																				<p>Attention to detail is key in many aspects of life. As they say, the "devil is in the details". We all want things simple, I'm the first one in line, but, something deep inside tells us that the details are what matters. It's probably the reason BMW is the best in the car business, because the attention to Details the engineers have. It shows over and over again. We pride ourselves on the fact that we are making a detailed pay stub. Probably the <a title="New York Pay Stub Generator" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/new-york-pay-stub-generator/">best pay stub maker</a> online.</p>
<p>We have been in this business for many years, and we have accountants on staff that are very meticulous.   Plus, we are constantly refining the product.   I cannot stress enough,  the <strong>details of a paystub</strong> are huge, if you want it to look as authentic as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Authentic pay stubs</strong> are key for your goals.    There is no point in saving money creating or buying one, if it is not authentic.   This is something you will show with pride, and put your name behind it.    It must be detailed, and accurate and authentic for it to be useful, or, it's not useful what so ever.    We have the best of both worlds.   We have a great product, and we have a great price.    We've honed our service for so many years, that now, it's actually easy for us.   This way, we can pass the savings on to you, our customer.</p>
<p>After 1000's of paystubs, we make it easy.    The first few hundred were hard.   We went through pain staking work, and changes, and updates, and fixes.   You can do that too, but, you have to do it a few hundred times to get every last detail of your paystub perfect.</p>
<p>Or, you can just pay us a few bucks, and be done with in in a few minutes.</p>

																				<p>I've been making paystubs for a long time.   Years in fact, when I was doing bookeeping services, then a few websites before, and now with paycheck stub online.    I've seen every state, and every possible error, over and over again.    I get countless email of people that are asking me for help, with their stubs, or their purchases from competitors.     I have changed my site, so that it can <a title="How to make a pay stub – Step 1 of 5" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/how-to-make-a-pay-stub-step-1-5/">help you make your own paystubs</a>.</p>

<p>I've even started a 5 part series.    Which is taking me a long time to finish suprisingly.   I want to be as detailed as possible, which requires me to get down and dirty..  as it's not easy to create a good one.   A realistic paystub.    An authentic paystub.   Free from erros, and editing issues.    I see what people have created, and realize how bad they are doing, and how bad the math skills are..</p>

<p>But, I do know people will still want to make their own, so, here goes.   Just to prove to you that I'm trying to help.  I've opened up my numbers and calculations to everyone, so you can see what you should do..  Thereby eliminating the complete issues of doing your own calculations.   I would still check them, but, now, you don't have to worry about <a title="How to Make a Pay Stub For Free – Step 2-5" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/how-to-make-a-pay-stub-for-free-step-2-5/">step #2  </a>in the How to make a paystub free series.</p>

<p>We often get these emails when someone uses our stubs, after working hard, and then being able to buy or get what they need. You can't get anything for free. you still have to work, and make the money, now, this just proves that you actually do that. There is no point in lying about how much you make, becasue you still have to have the money. But, why pay an accountant or an accounting service to create these paystubs for you, when you yourself know how much you make.. You know how much you pay in taxes. just create it with our paystub generator. Like this customer did.. And you'll be happy.</p>
<p>Yes, I do realize that this customer only said "Thanks".   Yes, I do wish he would be more descriptive, about how great my service is, and how much of a cool and funny guy I am.   and that he would tell you to buy the paystubs..   But, I'm assuming he's busy, and in fact, I'm glad he took the time to respond.   Because as much as I love this site, I do realize this is just one minute little spec of an item that you need to get going in your day.   That's why I'm so surprised when people want to spend hours and hours to create a paystub, that is not perfect, and the numbers won't even add up.   it's just 7$  and it's done in a second.. so..  please don't waste your time..  buy mine, get it done in 45 seconds... and then continue on with your life, and take 4 minutes to write how cool this website is..</p>
<p>Enjoy</p>

																				<h2>Creating a Pretty Pay Stub Template,</h2>
<p>Welcome back to our <a title="How to make a pay stub – Step 1 of 5" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/how-to-make-a-pay-stub-step-1-5/">"how to make a pay stub" series</a>.    This is step 3, and if you haven't watched or read the first 2, you may need that, to get some numbers, and some calculations.    If you feel comfortable with those, then let's move on, and get some layout stuff going on, so that it looks like a <strong>pay stub.</strong></p>
<p>There is no defined way that a pay stub has to be shown.    There is no law, mandating anything in this respect.   Ultimately, your employer doesn't even have to give you one, they can simply give you a check, and be done with it.   But, they have realized it's best, so that they minimize questions from their employee, as to why the pay stub is so low.</p>
<p>"Where is all my money"....    Well, the answer, probably 20-40%  of it has gone to the government in some form or fashion.    Plus, there may be company loans, or Garnishments, or some sort of savings.   Maybe some Union dues,  or company parking..  blah blah blah..    It can get quite complicated actually.    That's why you need to have read the previous <a title="How to Make a Pay Stub For Free – Step 2-5" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/how-to-make-a-pay-stub-for-free-step-2-5/">step number 2</a>, getting the calculations straight.</p>
<p>But, I'm assuming you have all those numbers.   we're here just to make a pay stub template in this Article.</p>
<p>So, pay stubs have evolved over time, and have been categorized to a few styles, most of which will be familiar to you.    Here are two basic styles,  The first one shown here:</p>
<div id="attachment_1253" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Neat-400x600.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1253 " alt="Neat Pay Stubs" src="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Neat-400x600-300x190.jpg" width="300" height="190" srcset="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Neat-400x600-300x190.jpg 300w, http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Neat-400x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Consecutive Neat Stub</p></div>
<p>We call this our NEAT pay stub.    It's very basic, has been around forever, and lays out things pretty standard.    This is really the beginners <strong>pay stub</strong>.   Yeah, it works, but, it's tired,  and very common to old business systems, or small ma and pa shops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You won't see this style in modern day business, or anyone doing business with a computer, or a company that makes any decent money or has an accounting office.   As everyone knows this style is something made from a begginer accounting software, like quickbooks.   Which is fine..  we all have used that at one time..  But,  big companies don't use quickbooks.   They use things like SAP,   or some proprietary software.   Which will generate custom paystubs...   Or, they just farm out payroll to big companies, Like ADP...</p>
<p>This brings in a more Corporate pay stub, or professional style.   Again, this depends on where you are working.  If it's just a coffee shop, the NEAT style is fine.</p>
<p>The next pay stub, is called the <a title="Modern Pay Stub Sample" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/modern-pay-stub-sample/">MODERN style paycheck</a>..  it used to be the T-stub style, but, we've improved it.   and made it resemble something that would come from a big company.    Take a look at it below.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/modern-300px.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-1249 alignright" alt="modern-300px" src="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/modern-300px.gif" width="246" height="300" /></a>You can see, How this looks more and more like a true paystub, even with the check at the bottom.   Now, it is true, the check at the bottom should be removed, but, you can always put the word VOID on it, and tell them that you have direct deposit, which is always a nice touch.     Either way, this is much more professional than before.</p>
<p>So, what you have to do, is to create this in one of 2 ways.</p>
<p>1)   Create an Excel Spreadsheet,   and combine the columns, that you need, and line items.</p>
<p>2)   Use Word, but the data in a table, and then draw in the boxes underneath.</p>
<p>Truly, the #1 option is the best way to go.   It's a little more time consuming in the begining, but, truly the best way in the long run.   So, we will really focus on that.   instead of just drawing it in.     #1 option will allow for reuse, especially if you have multiple stubs.    Again, don't forget the math in that respect</p>
<p>So, If you look closely at that picture, you can count at least 6 columns.   If you want to create a spacer between all of them, You could argue it's 12 columns, just 6 of them are thin.    And you could argue further, that on the right side, where the name and address is, there is even more.   but, I don't want to make this confusing, so, I'll just all it 12.</p>
<p>If you are looking at excel, and see 12 columns, you won't see what we see in the pic.   But, that's ok, cause it's easy to change.   Just place your mouse on the top bar, and move it left or right, to get the width you need.</p>
<p>YOur first column, is EARNINGs.    but, it's not at the top,   it's about 20 rows down.</p>
<p>On that row, next to earnings, put a label as RATE,   and then next to that HOURS, then THIS PERIOD  and then YEARLY</p>
<p>Those are the columns that you will put your numbers into.</p>
<p>Now, above that...  you still need your address, and info.    So, go ahead, and put those numbers in there</p>
<p>Under earnings, type in the description ,and type of earnings, like SALARY, or HOURLY, or OVERTIME,  or COMMISSION.. etc...  and fill in the appropriate numbers you want.</p>
<p>Here is where the math comes in,  you must put in your YEARLY numbers..   That is just the number multiplied by the PERIODS.    And that number is based on how many times you are paid...  weekly, bi weekly, etc...    That calculation you have to do..</p>
<p>If you are doing consecutive pay stubs, you need to calculate this very very carefully.</p>
<p>Below that is your DEDUCTIONS.    Again, that is a calculated number.   and a percentage of your gross.    Remember, 401K  rules for deducting money before taxes, but, others are after taxes.  that is a difference of NET and GROSS deductions.   There are many, so, I won't go into details, but, you can look that up yourself.   We'll show you how in the next step.</p>
<p>To make it look legit, make sure you add some NOTES, and info from the company, etc..   all to make it look legit</p>
<p>DATES:    This is probably the hardest one, because it is easy to screw up.    Your HIRE date, your start date your pay date, and your PRINT date, are all different..   and need to make sense.    And they all depend on how you get paid.   So, it's not in the scope of this article to figure that out for you, but, think about the difference in Months, and Weekends,  Holidays, etc.</p>
<p>To give it a true flare, you can create some parts BOLDED, or underlined, similar to your pay stub.   and you need to look up how to do that.   with a true template, or a real pay stub in hand, so you can copy it.     You can play with that, to make it look legit, we've been tweaking our pay stub generator for about 2 years, with minute details to get it perfect,  <a title="Pay Stub Generator" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/pay-stub-generator/">authentic and professional pay stub</a></p>

																				<p>I've been asked this by many customers, and accused of it by a few as well.  <strong> Is this pay stub site a scam</strong>?  A new customer may ask.</p>
<p>To this, I must say, of course NOT....   it's first a silly question, I mean, if it was a scam, and someone was scamming you, they wouldn't tell you that it was a scam..   That is just silly..   but, I'm here to tell you, that it is not a scam, and I can prove it.   I have foto's of actual pay stubs, and I give free Pay stub previews with your data on it, with the PREVIEW watermark on top of it..    So, If I've gone to the trouble of making the pay stub, why would I hold up your request.   I want nothing more than you to be happy with the product, and come back to my site to use it again, not to mention, if someone you know needs a pay stub, then I want you to recommend my site to them.  It's the best form of advertising.    So, no, it's not a scam.</p>
<p>Then, I get this other accusation, which I truly am offended by.   "<strong>Where is my pay stub, this is a scam!!</strong>"  An old customer may say.</p>
<p>The only reason you may not get your pay stub, is something went wrong, perhaps you forgot to put in your paystub, or you spelled it wrong, or I was working on the site, while you hit submit, and it was down, or the web server burped.   It doesn't matter why.   The fact that you don't have your product is not good, and I want to fix it ASAP.   If you paid, and didn't get a pay stub, please contact me, and let me know.  But, please do it politely, and don't accuse me of things, before we speak.  I truly want you to have  your product, and I will fix the problem, and make it good for you.   I haven't had many problems with this lately, but, i used to, when the website was new, a few years ago.   Now, I just get the ones that have errors.    It's not a finger pointing thing, it's just a problem that we have to fix, and I want it fixed.    It's very important to me.</p>
<p>This makes me think, what is the definition of a scam?  Because I'm too lazy to look it up in the dictionary, but, I'm sure it's along the lines of, making someone believe something that is not true, maybe that's the definition of a lie, but, a scam is more of the action of leading someone to think something, and then take action, when in fact, it wasn't true.    Well, I can tell you, this site, does not do that.   We show you the stub you will get, and when you pay, you will get that pay stub, without the watermark, it's that simple.   What you do with it, or why you need it, is completely up to you.</p>
<p>I hope you will enjoy the pay stubs from this website.    I want this site to be the best pay stub site on the web.   Your satisfaction and your input will help make it that.   <a title="Georgia Pay Stub Generator" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/georgia-pay-stub-generator/">Enjoy our stubs</a>..</p>

																				<p>Part 2 – How to make a pay stub - Detailed</p>
<p>Welcome to our series on how to make a pay stub for free, in 5 steps.   Fully detailed.   If you haven't read the first part of this series, here is a link to <a title="How to make a pay stub – Step 1 of 5" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/how-to-make-a-pay-stub-step-1-5/">Step 1 of how to make a pay stub</a></p>
<p>We are at the part where we show you how to perform Calculations on the pay stub form.    There are a few here, but, they are not difficult.   First, you have to know how to use Excel.   It is not complicated either, but, a few ground rules are there, for the scope of this tutorial.</p>
<p>It’s a good thing to know as well.  So, basically, a spread sheet document is full of cells, that interact with each other, and the way the interact is with “forumlas”.   These formulas can be very easy, to very complicated.   For Pay stubs, it’s relatively easy.   In English, it’s basically “Cell 1, multiplied or added or divided by Cell 2, is equal to Cell 3.</p>
<p>In mathematics terms, it looks like the following:</p>
<p>CELL 1  +   CELL 2   =    CELL 3</p>
<p>An in Excel, it looks like this:</p>
<p>D6 = E6 * F6</p>
<div id="attachment_1239" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-16-at-11.19.27-AM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1239" alt="Pay stub calculation example" src="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-16-at-11.19.27-AM-300x176.png" width="300" height="176" srcset="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-16-at-11.19.27-AM-300x176.png 300w, http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-16-at-11.19.27-AM.png 423w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pay stub calculation example</p></div>
<p>The fact that it’s D   and it’s 6  doesn’t matter..   that’s just which cell I selected,  and they could have been anyone…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the way you write it, is really simple, with the aid of Excel.   You just select the Cell with your mouse that you want the final number to be in, and then hit the ‘=’  key.  That tells Excel that you want to write an equation.    At that point, using your mouse, you can select any cell you want, in my example, I selected E6 then you select the ‘operator’   like PLUS or TIMES or DIVIDE,   in my example I put the asterisk,  *,  which means MULTIPLY.    And then, with your mouse, select the cell you want to multiply by, which is F6 in my example.</p>
<p>So, a good example would be, if you want to figure out how much you would make in one pay period, you would multiply your hours *  pay-rate.</p>
<p>Let’s say you put your pay rate of $10 in cell E6  and your hours as 40 in F6.    You would do exactly as I said above,  click the appropriate cells, and you would have a result in the first cell</p>
<div id="attachment_1240" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-4.19.52-AM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1240" alt="pay stub calculation" src="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-4.19.52-AM-300x155.png" width="300" height="155" srcset="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-4.19.52-AM-300x155.png 300w, http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-17-at-4.19.52-AM.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">40 hrs x $10 = $400</p></div>
<p>Ok, so, now that you get the basics of formula, you can do all the calculations.    There are a few..   and you’ll have to add the ones you need.   The primary of course is the following</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GROSS PAY = HOURLY * PAY RATE</p>
<p>DEDUCTIONS = STATE tax + FEDERAL tax + Medicare + SSN + Fica</p>
<p>FEDERAL tax = GROSS PAY * Your tax bracket</p>
<p>STATE tax = GROSS PAY * Your tax bracket</p>
<p>MEDICARE = same</p>

						<p class="et_pt_blogmeta">Posted by <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/author/shawn/" title="Posts by shawn dumouchele" rel="author">shawn dumouchele</a> on Jan 30, 2014 in <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/category/pay-check-stubs/" rel="category tag">Pay Check Stubs</a> | <span>Comments Off<span class="screen-reader-text"> on How to make a pay stub &#8211; Step 1 of 5</span></span></p>

						
						
																				<p>I have so many requests and questions about how to make a pay stub. So, instead of answering everyone seperately, and probably not fully, I'm going to make a definitive series on how to do it yourself. So, here goes. I hope you like it, and feel free to comment to help show others how to make a pay stub.</p>
<p>In these series we will focus, in separate articles, on the following items</p>
<p>1) Collecting Data - % values, Deductions, State Tax code, Federal Tax code<br />
2) Working with Excel - Equations, Calculations<br />
3) Creating a pretty template - Layout, drawing, etc<br />
4) Usage of online tools<br />
5) printing</p>
<p>Overall, I'd say creating a basic pay stub is easy. The devil is in the details. You can make a lot of little errors, each of which can be fixed, over time. The problem is, that you will have only one chance to use it, and it better be right. We've been working on our templates for years, and we still have users pointing out minor spelling mistakes, or alignment of bars. Usually they are not very visible, but, for someone who knows that they're looking at, or someone who is looking to doubt you, they will find every wrong thing.</p>
<p>So, this is part one, and we will be looking at collecting data. Before you can make calculations, you need to know the deductions and payment amounts from the government, and the IRS, so you can know how much % to take out. You also need to know what the <a title="What are tax brackets" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/what-are-tax-brackets/">pay stub tax brackets</a> are. I've written a few articles about tax brackets, but, I will provide you all these values on here.</p>
<p>You also need to know the federal taxes.  They are as follows:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Tax Bracket (Single)</b></td>
<td><b>Tax Bracket (Married)</b></td>
<td><b>Tax Bracket (Head of Household)</b></td>
<td><b>Marginal Tax Rate</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$0+</td>
<td>$0+</td>
<td>$0+</td>
<td><b>10%</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$8,925+</td>
<td>$17,850+</td>
<td>$12,750+</td>
<td><b>15%</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$36,250+</td>
<td>$72,500+</td>
<td>$48,600+</td>
<td><b>25%</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$87,850+</td>
<td>$146,400+</td>
<td>$125,450+</td>
<td><b>28%</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$183,250+</td>
<td>$223,050+</td>
<td>$203,150+</td>
<td><b>33%</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$398,350+</td>
<td>$398,350+</td>
<td>$398,350+</td>
<td><b>35%</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$400,000+</td>
<td>$450,000+</td>
<td>$425,000+</td>
<td><b>39.6%</b></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You can use this table to figure out your Marginal tax rate that you pay the federal government.</p>
<p>Continuing on..  you now need to know your state tax values, and each bracket.   This would make this post about 50X  as large, so, I'll spare you that here, but, I've done one thing better.   I've created a separate page for every state, which shows a similar breakdown of your state.   If you just click on the CHECK STUBS menu, find your state, and scroll to the bottom of the page.   You'll see the values and tax brackets.    <a title="Georgia Pay Stub Generator" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/georgia-pay-stub-generator/">Click Here for an example of Georgia Pay Stub taxes</a>, and you can see that it will help you greatly.   I've spent a lot of time creating these pages.</p>
<p>Next, you'll need to get the numbers for the standard deductions, like medicare,  Social Security, and the like.   This is summed up below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://taxes.about.com/od/payroll/a/Social-Security-Taxes.htm">Social Security tax</a> withholding (6.2% up to the <a href="http://biztaxlaw.about.com/od/glossarys/g/socialsecmax.htm">annual maximum</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://taxes.about.com/od/payroll/a/Medicare-Tax.htm">Medicare tax</a> withholding (1.45%)</li>
<li><a href="http://taxes.about.com/od/Types-of-Taxes/fl/Additional-Medicare-Tax.htm">Additional Medicare tax</a> withholding (0.9%) for employees earning over $200,000 (this is a new tax withholding requirement starting in the year 2013)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have most of the the external information.   the only thing that is left for your pay stub, is for you to make a decision on the other deductions that you will have.   This is completely based on what you think your company would deduct.   for example</p>
<ul>
<li>Cell phone</li>
<li>Medical Insurance</li>
<li>Union Dues</li>
<li>Garnishments</li>
<li>Car allowance</li>
<li>Loss of License Insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list can go on and on.. and is very specific.   This is a level of complexity and Authenticity that you need to decide.</p>
<p>So, once you have all these numbers, you are ready for the next step on how to make a pay stub.  If you know Excel, this will be easy.   If you don't, well, this will be a good lesson in excel.</p>

																				<p>Illinois Pay Stubs or Paycheck stubs are quite simple actually. For such a corrupt state, I'm not sure why they make it so simple. In fact, most of the taxes, Federal and State should be so simple. Just a simple flat tax, that we all can live with. Taxes on our pay stub is a fact of life, don't even get me started on my rant about how unfair it is to tax people that are working, and reward people that are not via welfare. <a title="Tax Brackets and your Paystub explained – Paystub Maker" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/tax-brackets-and-your-paystub-explained-paystub-maker/">You can read my taxes article about that here</a>.   But, I digress...  Back to Illinois pay stub Generator.</p>
<p>As you may have figured, there is a lot to making a paystub, especially if you need to make consecutive ones.   That is not easy.   Even in Illinios, with it's flat 5% tax.   Primarily, because you have to calculate your Federal Taxes and Medicare, SS,  and the rest of them..   Also, not to mention, if you work in Illinois, and want a realistic pay stub, you may have to change your hours of work... Not everybody works exactly 40 hrs in a week.. sometimes, you have overtime, sometimes you work less than 40 hours, like 38 hrs..  and that has to be calculated cumulatively.   There are all things that you need to figure in when you create your stubs..<br />

																				<p>Pennsylvania is the home of Butler Aviation.   It was one of the first places I flew into, while working as a pilot.  I didn't need a Pennsylvania pay stub generator at the time, but, some of the people there now sure do.   It has become a little bit of a depressed area, with all the industry moving away, primarily the Steel industry.   Unfortunately, that has all gone to China and South America.</p>
<p>The nice thing about Pennsylvania, the state taxes are quite low, and not complicated.   I love when states do that.  just a flat tax, for everyone..  it makes it fair, unlike some of the other states, who increase the tax on people earning more.  It almost seems like they are being punished for working harder, or working smarter.   Also, in reverse, they are rewarding the poor, or the people that have made poor choices or the people that don't want to work as hard.</p>
<p>So, I applaud Pennsylvania for their fairness, and you can see that when you make your <a title="PayCheck Stub Generator" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/simple-paystub-generator-v3-0" target="_blank">novelty pay stub maker</a>, using our Pennsylvania Pay stub Maker.   As you know, I'm very proud of this product, it is only meant for novelty or replacement use for your records..  But, I work on it all day, to make sure it is bug free, very accurate, and easy to use.     Novelty Stubs or Replacement pay stubs are necessary to be accurate, legible, and usable.   We pride ourselves on all kinds of Pay stubs.</p>

<p>In life, there are times when someone asks us to prove our income.  Either to rent an apartment or to buy a car or to get a loan.   This is fair and expected.    The lender, if they believe you want to pay the loan back, must also verify that you have the ability to pay back.   The ability to pay back is verified that you have a a steady job, that you will most likely not get fired from.   This is where the pay stub comes into play.   Your pay stub shows that you have an hourly salary, your deductions, your taxes, maybe your position in the company and other items that are interesting to the lender.    Different parts of the country, people may look at slightly different things.   A <a title="New York Paycheck Stubs" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/new-yor-paycheck-stubs">New york pay stub</a> or <a title="New Jersey Paycheck paystub Maker" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/new-jersey-paycheck-paystub-maker">New Jersey pay stub</a>s have different items than <a title="Florida PayStub Generator" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/florida-paystub-generator">Florida pay stubs</a> or Illinois pay stubs.   Knowing what your state requires is important to make an authentic pay stub.   Here are 5 ways how to make a pay stub.</p>
<p>In no particular order, here are some ideas:</p>
<p>1)   Get an accounting software like Quicken - If you can get access to this software, and you have some accounting skills, this program, for an additional fee, will allow you to have a module that prints paystubs.   Quicken basic usually runs for about $50  and the addon is about 35$  last time I checked.</p>
<p>2)   Create one on Excel - $150 -If you already have Excel on your computer, or at work, you can just create a grid, and put all the numbers in there.   One is easy, but, it gets a bit difficult if you do more, because you have to calculate YTD information for all items.   Based on how many times you get paid, and how many you need.    Rememember, that each pay stub is not the same.   If you get paid every two weeks, your first may have your medical withdrawls while your second pay stub will have your 401k Retirement.    It's not as easy as it sounds on excel</p>
<p>3)   Create one on Google Docs - $0.00 - Free Pay stub - This is basically the same as above, but, no cost.  If you've never used Google docs, it's quite impressive, and you need to get on the ball.   They are competing directly with Microsoft, you don't need a powerful computer, and all your data is saved in the cloud.  This means you can access it anywhere there is an internet computer.  Even on your phone, although that is not easy.</p>
<p>4)   Buy a Template - Again, almost the same as 2 and 3 above, but, at least with the template, the layout looks good, and you will save your time without fudging with that stuff.   You do want to look professional and all don't you?   Well, a pay stub template is a good way to start, but, you still run into the problem of accurate numbers.</p>
<p>5)   Buy an <a title="PayCheck Stub Generator – Simple" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/simple-paystub-generator-v3-0">online pay stub maker</a> - I have to self promote, but, my site is so cheap and fast and accurate and authentic.   I've spent years working on this software to make it better, ironing out every little detail that comes up.  What I do is not impossible for you, but, how much time are you willing to invest.  for a few dollars, you can be finished in 2 minutes.   Then, you can go on with your life.   Creating a pay stub is not a skill you will ever need again.. it's a one time thing, so don't waste your time, and just use a service for it, get a good product, and move on</p>
<p>That's my view of 5 ways how to make a pay stub.  There are others, and if you can suggest, put them in the comments, and I'll review them if you like.</p>

																				<p>Business owners, Entrepreneurs, Contractors all have a few things in common.   They all have ambition, are hard working, deal with WAY more complicated problems than regular employees, and they are what made this country great in the first place.   Unfortunately, they have another thing in common, they all have to prove <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/paycheck-stub-generator">Proof Of Income</a> almost all the time, when dealing with large companies, landlords, or banks.     You would think that the fact they have money in the bank, and many tools of their trade as collateral, or the fact that they've paid their bills in the past as enough.   But, no, you need that small piece of paper, which has to be accurate, to show to some clerk at an institution.</p>
<p>That is just one more headache that these good American have to deal with on a daily basis.  Paystubs are meant for employees, not Business owners.   Especially if you are self employed.  What person in their right mind, is going to send themselves a Paycheck paystub, when they already have the money.  It seems silly and time wasting.</p>
<p>I had the same problem when I was developing websites.   I worked from home, and met with clients at startbucks.   When I completed something, they gave me a check, and I cashed it, and then spent it.    No paystub.   No paycheck.   But, I did need <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/paycheck-stub-generator">proof of income</a>.   So, that's why I developed this software.   It's online, it's instantaneous, You can download a free preview, you can choose from many templates, it's accurate, and I can help.</p>
<p>I am constantly adding templates, making it more accurate, and easier to use.   I love feedback about my Paystub generator, because I want it to constantly be the latest and greatest technology.   This is a hobby for me, but, I do use it for myself too.    I add up what I made, but it in the <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/paycheck-stub-generator">Paystub generator </a>and print it out.   It helps me keep a constant record.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you will use it, enjoy it, and tell me how to make it better.</p>

																				<p>North Carolina, one of my favorite states. My mom and sister live in Raleigh/Durham. I'm quite a fan of the people there actually. The taxes are a little high. Sometimes, driving around that part of North Carolina, I wonder where the tax dollars go.</p>
<p>But, let's delve into it. Our North Carolina Paycheck paystub calculator shows you, that it's quite simple to figure out the taxes.. Basically just figure 7%. If you make more than 100k on your North carolina paycheck paystub, then you'll spend a little more on taxes, but, only .75 of a percent. that's .0075. Not very much..</p>
<p>If you make less that 21,500$ on your North Carolina paycheck paystub, you'll be charged only a little less, about 6%, or .06 times your taxable amount.</p>
<p>Don't forget, you can lower your taxable amount by certain things on your paycheck paystub. Like 401k, or union dues. Or, even a health care spending account.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out our <a title="PayCheck Stub Generator – Simple" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/simple-paystub-generator-v3-0">North Carolina Paycheck paystub calculator</a>. It will do all the calculations for you. Then, you can choose the design, and print it out. If you're happy, pay us 7$, and we'll send you a non-watermark version of it. Ready for use.</p>

						<p class="et_pt_blogmeta">Posted by <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/author/shawn/" title="Posts by shawn dumouchele" rel="author">shawn dumouchele</a> on Apr 11, 2013 in <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/category/paycheck-taxes-explained/" rel="category tag">Paycheck taxes explained</a> | <span>Comments Off<span class="screen-reader-text"> on Tax Brackets and your Paystub explained &#8211; Paystub Maker</span></span></p>

						
						
																				<p>A brief breakdown of your paystub and the federal witholding tax.   It is really quite simple.   What confuses people when they compare the table given below, and their pay check is that people automatically think that it is a percentage of their whole income.   This is not the case, your tax brackets on your paystub are progressive.   Which means, you get taxed on different levels differently.    The first level is taxed at one level and then the next at a different level, until you reach your final level.</p>
<p>So, for example, 2 people make 34,000 and 36,000 respectively.    If you look at the table, you'll incorrectly see that Person A will be taxed at 15%  and person B  will be taxed at 25%..   that is NOT CORRECT, and your Paystub will show it, or at least it should.</p>
<p>The correct way to be taxed is much more fair.   According to the table, both people will be taxed at 15%  up to the 35,350  level, then, person B will have only the remaining $650 at 25%.    This prevents people from working a few hours less a year, just to be below certain tax bracket.</p>
<p>Tax Brackets for Income Earned in 2012</p>
<p>Tax rate Single filers Married filing jointly or qualifying widow/widower Married filing separately Head of household<br />
10% Up to $8,700 Up to $17,400 Up to $8,700 Up to $12,400<br />
15% $8,701 – $35,350 $17,401 – $70,700 $8,701- $35,350 $12,401 – $47,350<br />
25% $35,351 – $85,650 $70,701 – $142,700 $35,351 – $71,350 $47,351 – $122,300<br />
28% $85,651 – $178,650 $142,701 – $217,450 $71,351 – $108,725 $122,301 – $198,050<br />
33% $178,651 – $388,350 $217,451 – $388,350 $108,726 – $194,175 $198,051 – $388,350<br />
35% $388,351 or more $388,351 or more $194,176 or more $388,351 or more</p>
<p>If you think about it, doing it the incorrect way, the person making less, would actually earn more overall because they're being taxed at 10% less on their money than person B..    And there would be plenty of lawyers protecting your Paycheck paystub ready to go to court at a moments notice.</p>

																				<p>Well, here I am, using my own service.   So, I make a small income from this website.  When someone needs a check, they pay me, and then I deposit in my bank.  After paying my bank a little something something of course.  The fat cats can't stay fat without us slaves.   But, I digress.</p>
<p>So, I pay my bills from the bank account, and a debit card.    I have direct withdraw from my bank to pay my living accommodations.   So, I now went to apply for some local health insurance that I am entitled to, based on my problems and my living situation.   Fully legal and legit.  I am a taxpayer.  So, no problems.</p>
<p>Guess what was the first thing they ask me?</p>
<p>Sir, for this application, you need to show proof of income.  So, I said ok, I have bank accounts, and paypal statements.  The answer to the girl behind the computer was,</p>
<blockquote><p>sir, that is not a proof of income.   To <strong>show proof of income</strong>, you need to have paychecks made out to you, or your bank with you account number</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though I was right, and the bank statement shows that i have income, they want to see a paycheck stub. With all the little details. And, they need to see the past 2-3 stubs. And they better be in order.</p>
<p>So, I am updating my website. Because of these ding dongs, to help people like you and me out.</p>
<p>You will not be able to select how many weeks or pay periods you want, and it will allow you to have 3 paychecks in order. I know, it's ridiculous, but, the dumb-ing down of our society, we have to figure out how to survive. I hope you like the product, and let me know if there is anything i can do to make it better.</p>

																				<p>There are 3 main witholdings that pertain to the federal government only. There are others, but, we are only describing the three main ones that every paycheck will have.</p>
<p>1) Social Security = 6.2% of the first $110,100 in 2012<br />
2) Medicare = 1.45% of the total<br />
3) Federal tax = Refer to tables below (single, or dual)</p>
<p>Income                   Pay                    + % of                      Amount Over</p>
<p>&lt; $2,100                 $0                        0%                             $0.00<br />
&lt; $10,600           $0.00                    10%                            $2,100</p>
<p>&lt; $36,600       $850.00                   15%                           $10,600</p>
<p>&lt; $85,700      $4,750.00                 25%                          $36,600</p>
<p>&lt;$176,500     $17,025.00                28%                           $79,725</p>
<p>$381,250       $110,016.50               35%                          $381,250</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are filing as a married couple, or not head of household, it would be different.  The details are actually quite complex for Tax witholdings.  That is why we have created the Paycheck stub generator, or the paystub generator.</p>
<p>It does two things.   One, is it calculates the federal withholding amount, and then it calculates the state witholding amount.  then, it adds anything else you want, like Union dues, or 401k, or Medical insurance.</p>
<p>And fortunately, it figures out the numbers for you, accurately and instantly.   So your <a title="PayCheck Stub Generator" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/paycheck-stub-generator">paycheck stub</a> will reflect a correct amount.</p>

																				<p>I love looking at my pay stub, it feels like work accomplished, and the knowledge that there is a paycheck attached to it, that I will bring to my bank, and refill the coffers.   Although I am a bit peeved at some of those damn deductions.  Who is Fica?  I don't use Medicare.  Union dues?   Federal tax, State tax.   it's non stop.</p>
<p>Not to mention, <a title="What are tax brackets" href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/what-are-tax-brackets">what are tax brakets</a>?</p>
<p>It is a bit confusing, and maybe we need to do a run through of all the things that it could be.  But, for now, you can just view our PayCheck Stub Maker to see what you would make in various situations.  Plus, you can print out a copy for yourself.</p>

						<p class="et_pt_blogmeta">Posted by <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/author/shawn/" title="Posts by shawn dumouchele" rel="author">shawn dumouchele</a> on Jun 29, 2012 in <a href="http://www.paycheckstubonline.com/category/pay-check-stubs/" rel="category tag">Pay Check Stubs</a> | <span>Comments Off<span class="screen-reader-text"> on What are tax brackets</span></span></p>

						
						
																				<h1>Tax brackets</h1>
<p>are created in some states, to help out some people that don't make as much as others.   There is a base amount that every human being needs to live, pay for shelter, food, necessities, and then, gradually it gets less and less important.  Very wealthy people have a lot of luxuries, that they think they can't live without, but, we all know, they can.  A gold plated toilet on a private jet, could easily be replaced with a coach seat on a major airline.<br />
So, tax brackets were developed to take away more, as you made more.  They are an attempt to be gradual, but, they are not.  There are various tax brackets in the USA, but an example of one would be the following:</p>
<p>if you make &lt;  $20,000  Your tax would be 5%</p>
<p>if you make &gt; $20,001  and &lt; less than $60,000 Your tax would be 7%</p>
<p>if you make &gt; %60,000 you then would be taxed at 9%</p>
<p>With that in mind, it sometimes shows that if you make less, you actually get more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take for example two employees.  One comes in an extra hour on saturday to do some work.  They get paid 10$ per hour, so one makes $59,995 and the other makes $60,005 in that year.    They are only 10$  apart from each other, but, in a different Tax Brackets</p>
<p>First employee will take home      59,995 - (59,995 x .07)  =  $55,795</p>
<p>Second employee will take home 60,005 - (60,005 x .09) = $54,604</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it makes sense for Second employee to work less, he will make more.   Basically, the government is punishing the employee for working harder than others.</p>

<p>I have a good job, but not a great job.  I'm not a millionaire.  But, I saw my girlfriend had an account on a millionair matchmaker website.   Because she was looking to cash out.  How Shallow.   And look at all these shows about "hooking up" with someone rich.   It's garbage.</p>

																				<p>The last time I rented an apartment, I was self employed, but, and I had money in the bank, and was about to get a regular job as well.  But, I had to wait 2 weeks until I got one.  The previous job was a joke, and I didn't have any PayCheck Stubs, because I threw them away.   I had to stay with friends, and then a hotel because the friends stopped being friends, which got expensive.   So, I decided to get an apartment, but, I quickly found out that all landlords need proof of income.  This came as quite a shock to me actually.   </p>
<p>This went on quite a while, as I fought it, and the dragging on got to be a problem with family, friends and relationships.   I was working like a dog, doing everything right, but, everything was falling apart quickly.   All because I needed to show a paycheck Stub.  All landlords need proof of income, or pay via a pay stub, or a paycheck stub.  So, I got refused at three different places for rent, with a down payment, and money in hand.</p>
<p>This website will help you.  Especially if you are legitimately getting a job, and have the money to pay for your place.   I do not recommend you use this to forage anything.   It just helps for you to get through some non legal hoops.</p>
