<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.3.1 also fixes twenty-six bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.3.1">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.3/?rev=34199&amp;stop_rev=33647">list of changes</a>.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard.

<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.3:</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard.

<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>The Team</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

	<title>Akismet: Akismet WordPress Plugin 3.1.4</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1873</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/09/24/akismet-3-1-4-wordpress/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Version 3.1.4 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the Akismet plugin for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; is now available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update clarifies the error messages that Akismet uses so that they&amp;#8217;re easier to understand, and it enables link previews in the admin for all links in a comment &amp;#8212; not just the author&amp;#8217;s website link. A fix is also included for a bug that could have caused comment moderation emails to be sent for some comments that were caught as spam.  For a full list of the changes in this release, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/akismet/trunk&quot;&gt;revision log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions. If you need to download the plugin zip file directly, links to all versions are available in &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the WordPress plugins directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1873&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WP Comment Humility Relocates the Comments Top-level Menu Item to the Posts Menu</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48313</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-comment-humility-relocates-the-comments-top-level-menu-item-to-the-posts-menu</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-billie-named-after-jazz-singer-billie-holiday-is-available-for-download&quot;&gt;features in WordPress 4.3&lt;/a&gt; is that comments on pages are disabled by default. If you only enable comments for posts, you may be interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;WP Comment Humility&lt;/a&gt;, a new plugin created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;John James Jacoby&lt;/a&gt; that moves the top-level Comments menu item to the Posts menu. The following screenshot better illustrates what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48314&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png?resize=429%2C378&quot; alt=&quot;Comment Humility in Action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Comment Humility in Action
&lt;p&gt;If a site enables comments for posts only, this location for the menu item makes sense. What if you&amp;#8217;re using Custom Post Types? According the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/faq/&quot;&gt;plugin&amp;#8217;s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, the user experience might be weird, &amp;#8220;If you have a post type other than &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; that supports comments, it may make more sense to not use this plugin,&amp;#8221; Jacoby said. He suggests giving it a try and if the user experience doesn&amp;#8217;t feel right, to disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/stuttter/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;located on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; where you can also submit Pull Requests. WP Comment Humility works out-of-the-box without any configuration options on WordPress 4.3 and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; in the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Highlights From Matt Mullenweg’s Q&amp;A Session on Product Hunt</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48303</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/highlights-from-matt-mullenwegs-qa-session-on-product-hunt</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;On September 22nd, Matt Mullenweg participated in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;question and answer session&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. Product Hunt is a site &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;that lets users share and discover new products. In the session, Mullenweg answers questions like what advice he&amp;#8217;d give to his 20 and 25-year-old self and how he combats burn out. Here are a few highlights from the session.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nikhil V&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Hello Matt, with the upcoming release of the WP REST API in WordPress core, what do you hope to most see built with its capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m hugely excited about the REST API! Once the infrastructure is in, I think we&amp;#8217;ll see really widespread adoption from plugins that right now are creating their endpoints in very ad-hoc ways. Once we iterate a bit more on the core content endpoints and authentication I think we&amp;#8217;ll see a lot more specialized interfaces built on WP as like a content kernel, an engine powering a wide array of applications and interfaces you&amp;#8217;d never imagine having WordPress behind them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erik Torenberg &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;If you could go back in time and give advice for your, say, 20-year-old self, what would you tell yourself? How about 25?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; To my 20-year-old self I would say to be okay with things building up over time. Something I didn&amp;#8217;t appreciate until recently is that there any many productive decades ahead with which to build the things that I feel need to exist in the world. One of the best things I did then was avoid any press or capitalization on my age (to the extent I could) because youth is an ephemeral asset and just a novelty in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my 25-year-old self I would tell him to slow down and think about health more, I burned the candle at both ends that year. I would also say to not get as caught up in mailing list and IRC arguments and discussions, just focus on building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sydney Liu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In the early days of WordPress, what was the 20% that got you the 80% of the results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; There&amp;#8217;s no simple answer there, if I had to pick one thing it would be &lt;em&gt;luck&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Kristof Bernaert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; How do you see WP about 5 years, or how do you want it to see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In 5 years I think that WP will be infinitely easier to use for both power-users, developers, and newbies. You will be able to have a full experience of core, plugins, themes, docs, and support in several dozen languages that will be as large or larger than English. There will be over a million people making their living on top of the platform. Most people will be creating from touch devices, and their content will mostly not come from keyboards (virtual or physical) as an input device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Tys Bradford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;&amp;#8211; Your accomplishments with WordPress have literally changed the face of the internet and enabled people without programming skills to make beautiful and functional websites. Do you think this could be replicated ever with mobile applications (iOS/Android)? I have seen a few companies try, but none have come close to delivering in the way WordPress is able to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Thank you! The ecosystems and app stores for iOS and Android right now are too locked down, and the discoverability and overhead of apps is too distorted, for an approach like WordPress&amp;#8217; to work for mobile applications. The environment for the foreseeable future there is going to favor more centralized apps, my only hope is that at least a few get really successful (including ours) that aren&amp;#8217;t advertising-driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Question Was Not Answered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my question was not answered. However, I&amp;#8217;m going to ask it in this post with the hope that he&amp;#8217;ll answer it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve spent a lot of time, money, and energy trying to create a great mobile experience in WordPress via dedicated apps. As more of the WordPress backend becomes responsive, how will this affect (if any) the priority level of developing the mobile apps versus putting that time and effort into a 100% responsive WordPress backend?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullenweg answers a lot more questions than what&amp;#8217;s listed above but those are the ones that stand out to me. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;read the entire session&lt;/a&gt; on the Product Hunt site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress REST API Is One Major Step Closer to Being Merged Into Core</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48284</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-rest-api-is-one-major-step-closer-to-being-merged-into-core</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After more than three years of development, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://v2.wp-api.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress REST API&lt;/a&gt; is one major step closer to getting merged into core. Ryan McCue, a lead contributor to the project, published the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;official proposal&lt;/a&gt; to merge the API into WordPress. The proposal explains what the REST API is, why it&amp;#8217;s needed, an integration plan, and what happens after the merge. The plan is to integrate the API in two stages, infrastructure and endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Part Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure is the code responsible for routing requests and handling the meta layer of the API, including JSON serialization/deserialization, linking, embedding, and REST best practices. Merging the infrastructure first allows developers to start building upon it and to migrate from existing custom code. The plan is to merge the infrastructure portion of the API in WordPress 4.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endpoints are considered the more complex of the two as they’re responsible for mapping data from the external JSON format to the internal data structures and vice versa. In other words, endpoints are the bridges of communication between WordPress and external applications. To provide more time for core committers to review the code, endpoints will be merged in WordPress 4.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of the API &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API&quot;&gt;takes place on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; but core WordPress development takes place on Subversion and Trac. When the API is merged into core, it will no longer be developed as a separate project. McCue proposes that the best of GitHub and Trac be integrated so developers comfortable with GitHub can continue to contribute to the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the team’s experience with GitHub as well as Trac, we can bring the best of both worlds by helping integrate the two. This would also improve contributions to WordPress as a whole, and benefit the whole community. This will be especially important as we encourage more contributions from the wider community (client authors, for example). We think we can make good progress here, and we’d love to try to help improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress&quot;&gt;GitHub repository for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;s synced to its Subversion counterpart, it does not accept pull requests. If integrating GitHub and Trac proves to be successful, it could open the door for WordPress to accept pull requests or contributions through GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan to merge the API into core is not finalized and the team needs your &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;comments, questions, and opinions&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage you to read the full proposal and the comments as McCue answers additional questions related to the merge. How happy are you to see this merge proposal?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The Impacts HeroPress Is Having on WordPress Communities in India</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48286</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-impacts-heropress-is-having-on-wordpress-communities-in-india</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Topher DeRosia, who recently attended&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia&quot;&gt; WordCamp Pune&lt;/a&gt;, India, &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/subtle-impacts/&quot;&gt;published a post on the HeroPress blog&lt;/a&gt; that describes the subtle impacts the project is having on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saurabh Shukla, lead organizer for WordCamp Pune, says the site inspired not only their speaker selection but their presentations as well, &amp;#8220;We wanted people to derive at least a level of inspiration from the speakers and decided that stories make more sense than presentations,&amp;#8221; Shukla said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of inspiring presentations at WordCamp Pune include, a workshop where people could experience accessibility issues for themselves, WordPress for activism, and building education products for South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Presentation in a Classroom at WordCamp Pune
&lt;p&gt;According to DeRosia, many Indians feel like their WordPress communities are not getting the respect they deserve. DeRosia believes the amount of excitement expressed by Indians for HeroPress is because their work is noticed and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;That&lt;/em&gt; is why India is excited about HeroPress. They’re getting respect. Not just from me, but from thousands of readers around the world,&amp;#8221; DeRosia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although DeRosia says he&amp;#8217;d be content with the impacts the site has had if HeroPress ended today, I would be sad to see it go  because it&amp;#8217;s a great addition to the WordPress community. Thankfully, DeRosia says people are requesting more essays, exchanges of knowledge, shared wisdom, shared respect, and more of the HeroPress spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an essay published on HeroPress or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;project&amp;#8217;s mission&lt;/a&gt; has inspired you in any way, please let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Interview, and Complementing Slack</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45326</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/09/complementing-slack/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.me/tonyconrad&quot;&gt;Tony Conrad&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strictlyvc.com/&quot;&gt;StrictlyVC&lt;/a&gt; event in San Francisco last week, following a dizzyingly talented line-up of &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/chamath-palihapitaya-on-insane-burn-rates-ipos-and-raising-a-new-real-estate-fund/&quot;&gt;Chamath Palihapitiya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dfj.com/content/steve-jurvetson&quot;&gt;Steve Jurvetson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/18/move-over-slack-automattic-mulls-commercializing-its-own-internal-messaging-product/&quot;&gt;Techcrunch has a good write-up with a number of the relevant quotes from the event&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing I&amp;#8217;d like to respond to, because it wasn&amp;#8217;t a direct quote, is the headline &amp;#8220;Move Over Slack? Automattic Mulls Commercializing Its Own Internal Messaging Product.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem is the headline missed the obvious alliteration of &amp;#8220;Mullenweg Mulls,&amp;#8221; &lt;img src=&quot;http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f600.png&quot; alt=&quot;😀&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;but more importantly&amp;#8230; &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; has become a really key tool for both Automattic &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;and WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt; and anything we do with the evolution of &lt;a href=&quot;http://p2theme.com/&quot;&gt;P2&lt;/a&gt; (some of which we already have running internally) will be complementary to Slack, not competitive with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jeff Yablon and the WordPress Foundation Settle Out of Court</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48267</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jeff-yablon-and-the-wordpress-foundation-settle-out-of-court</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation sued Jeff Yablon&lt;/a&gt; for trademark infringement. The Foundation wanted Yablon to stop using its trademarks, dismiss the opposition proceeding, pay the foundation for any profits related to use of the WordPress trademarks, pay up to $100,000 per infringing domain name, transfer the domains and pay other fees and damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline of Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 22nd, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=7&quot;&gt;Yablon filed a request&lt;/a&gt; for default judgement. On June 29th, the Foundation responded to Yablon by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=8&quot;&gt;asking the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board&lt;/a&gt; to deny Yablon&amp;#8217;s request for default judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 9th, David Mermelstein, Administrative Trademark Judge, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=9&quot;&gt;filed a response&lt;/a&gt; that not only denied Yablon&amp;#8217;s motion for default judgment, but also suspended proceedings until the civil case was complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With proceedings suspended, Yablon could no longer file motions or requests with the TTAB. The only option left was to proceed through court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Settlement Between Yablon and The Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 21st, Yablon and the WordPress Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudup.com/cLmq3DWS6MZ&quot;&gt;settled out of court&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48277&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png?resize=839%2C621&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of Settlement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sample of Settlement
&lt;h3&gt;Yablon&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the settlement, by no later than October 15th, Yablon agrees to cease any and all use of the WordPress name, logos, trademarks, and any other name or mark confusingly similar to the term WordPress or its logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also has to cease any and all use of the WordPress Marks, standing alone or in combination with other words or designs, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use in any company name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta-tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personalized URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyword Advertising on Yablon&amp;#8217;s websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media handles or account names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indoor outdoor store signage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letterhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stationary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon must also comply with the terms of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/&quot;&gt;WordPress trademark and domain name policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No later than five days after the effective date (Oct 15th), Yablon has to transfer all of the domains he owns that incorporate the WordPress Mark to the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Yablon acknowledges that the Foundation owns and has the exclusive rights in and to the WordPress marks in connection with the goods and services identified in each of WordPress&amp;#8217; registrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon can no longer do anything inconsistent with the Foundation&amp;#8217;s ownership of its WordPress Marks and registrations thereof, including but not limited to, contesting the Foundation&amp;#8217;s title to or the validity of the WordPress marks or the trademark registrations thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WordPress Foundation&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Yablon transfers the domains to the Foundation and does not breach the terms of the agreement, the Foundation will redirect the domains to a domain of Yablon&amp;#8217;s choosing for 6 months from the effective date or April 1, 2016, whichever comes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 10 days of the domains being transferred, the Foundation will file a stipulated request to withdrawal its U.S. Opposition Proceeding No. 91221895 without prejudice and Case 3:15-cv02745 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, without prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as Yablon does not breach the agreement, the Foundation agrees not to sue for violating its trademarks prior to the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation will not object to Yablon&amp;#8217;s use of the WordPress Marks as part of any subdomains or subdirectories associated with any second level domain name registered to and controlled exclusively by Yablon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples include but are not limited to, wordpress.answerguy.com or answerguy.com/wordpress in connection with services that involve use of the WordPress platform, support the WordPress brand services, and that do not otherwise violate the rights of the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parties agree to bear their own attorney&amp;#8217;s fees and costs, if any were incurred through the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;spoke to Yablon&lt;/a&gt; on the phone in June shortly after the lawsuit was filed, he sounded like he knew what he was getting into and the complexities involved with U.S. Trademarks. Yablon strongly believed he had enough evidence to pursue the matter and to see it through the court system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing the court case all the way through, he chose to give up which in the court system, is not the same thing as losing, as losing or winning sets a precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Yablon didn&amp;#8217;t lose the case, the WordPress Foundation didn&amp;#8217;t win either. It&amp;#8217;s a reminder that the Foundation will aggressively defend its trademarks in the court system if other means prove unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think Yablon’s mission to defend his use of WordPress in a top-level domain name and potentially open the door for others to do the same, was in the best interest of the WordPress community as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://poststatus.com/gravity-flow-makes-custom-form-administrative-workflows-simple/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;Gravity Flow&lt;/a&gt; is one of the coolest new plugins I&amp;#8217;ve seen in quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoices, purchase orders, job applications, and employee vacation requests are just a few potential applications for Gravity Flow, which makes form-centric approval, user input, and notification processes simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With Gravity Flow, you use the power of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; to design your forms, and you use Gravity Flow to design your process using easy to use drag-and-drop tools,&amp;#8221; the video states. The flows created in Gravity Flow can be customized to include all sorts of user-defined paths to request stakeholder feedback, get administrative approval, or fire off a notification that a certain step in the flow has been accomplished. It can even be integrated with other notification systems like Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that common to see a WordPress plugin (especially an add-on plugin) that simultaneously targets a niche and serves it so extensively. Gravity Flow is built to extend the powerful Gravity Forms product, and it really takes it an extra mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of potential for Gravity Flow for intranets and other corporate environments with lots of stakeholders and traditionally clunky, email based workflows for approval of common tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trying Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took Gravity Flow for a spin, because there is a handy demo site capability built in. For a plugin this complex, being able to test drive it is a really great feature. Most workflow tasks can take place either in the admin or on the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating workflows feels a lot like adding regular notifications to Gravity Forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14340&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-workflow-752x579.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workflows have many configuration and sending options. And each step can be sorted and arranged to follow a series of steps, and can even allow for delays (like for a scholarship review period, in my example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s the view for an administrator, but someone who is responsible for providing feedback or approval has a front-end view to directly interact with the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14339&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-review-update-workflow-752x872.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-review-update-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;872&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And administrators can see reports of activity for various workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14338&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-reports-752x552.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-reports&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;552&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty simple overview of the plugin, and I&amp;#8217;d recommend you &lt;a href=&quot;http://demo.gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the demo&lt;/a&gt;, or his full &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.gravityflow.io/category/34-walkthroughs&quot;&gt;walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; examples. but this at least highlights some of the plugin&amp;#8217;s power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Development of Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting things about Gravity Flow is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Henty&lt;/a&gt; made it. Steven actually works at Rocketgenius, the company behind Gravity Forms, and he is a developer of the main Gravity Forms product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to Steven about why this isn&amp;#8217;t a Gravity Forms official add-on, and what it&amp;#8217;s like working on a side project for your own company&amp;#8217;s product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocketgenius has a lot of plans and loads of really exciting stuff in the pipeline so it was a question of priorities &amp;#8211; Rocketgenius can’t possibly do absolutely everything at the same time. For me it’s a project that’s niche enough to be an interesting and profitable side project and yet not too time-consuming so I can continue to focus 100% on my day job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterated how important it is to him that he had his team behind him for this project. And Carl Hancock &amp;#8212; co-founder of Rocketgenius &amp;#8212; is excited about Steven&amp;#8217;s product as well, saying &amp;#8220;The product is awesome. It&amp;#8217;s definitely more complex [and] business oriented, but that&amp;#8217;s a good thing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl also shared that Steve has a background that lends itself to thinking about complex problems to solve, working on, &amp;#8220;more enterprise stuff pre-WordPress, on a wide variety of platforms and programming languages.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve did a great job with Gravity Flow, and I&amp;#8217;m happy to see it out there.  On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/gravity-flow/&quot;&gt;his personal blog&lt;/a&gt;, he highlights use cases for the product, which are real world examples based on how his first 100 beta testers are using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gravity ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Rocketgenius employees have Gravity Forms focused side projects, which I think is really cool. Another favorite of mine is David Smith&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://gravitywiz.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Wiz&lt;/a&gt;, that adds functionality snippets, or &amp;#8220;perks&amp;#8221;, to Gravity Forms. The third-party ecosystem is doing well too; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityplus.pro/&quot;&gt;Gravity Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityview.co/&quot;&gt;Gravity View&lt;/a&gt; are two healthy Gravity Forms focused businesses that come to mind, and I&amp;#8217;m sure there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main plugin continues to dominate the WordPress forms space. Though it is commercial only, it powers hundreds of thousands of websites, and has dozens of official &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/&quot;&gt;add-ons&lt;/a&gt;. Carl has told me many times he doesn&amp;#8217;t even view most other WordPress forms plugins as competition (though newer entrants like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ninjaforms.com/&quot;&gt;Ninja Forms&lt;/a&gt; are doing quite well for themselves), as Gravity Forms aims to take marketshare away from complex hosted solutions like Wufoo, rather than gobble up the much larger but less demanding market that just wants simple contact forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up with Gravity Flow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the website&lt;/a&gt;. And the project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stevehenty/gravityflow&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt; as well, as Steve is billing for support and automatic upgrades, which starts at €87 (around $100) per year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems like the longest days are those in between an Apple announcement and when the products are actually available. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to iOS 9, WatchOS 2, 6s+, Apple TV&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Recap of WordCamp Pune, India, by Topher DeRosia</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48212</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48213&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; href=&quot;http://topher1kenobe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Topher DeRosia&lt;/a&gt;. Topher has contributed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe#content-plugins&quot;&gt;number of plugins&lt;/a&gt;, spoken at many WordCamps, and is the lead of documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://easydigitaldownloads.com/&quot;&gt;Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/a&gt; He also operates &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/&quot;&gt;HeroPress.com&lt;/a&gt; on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last July, the lead organizer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pune.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Pune, India &lt;/a&gt;asked if I would come and speak about HeroPress. This post isn&amp;#8217;t going to be about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;HeroPress&lt;/a&gt; nor about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/category/wordcamp/pune/&quot;&gt;my adventures on the trip&lt;/a&gt;. No, this post is going to be about a WordCamp in a relatively large city in India, how it compares to American WordCamps, and some things that were experimented with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Similarities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, WordCamp Pune is exactly like every other WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve been to. The night before the event, there was a speaker dinner with excellent food and wonderful company. Registration was chaotic because WiFi was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone was happy and excited to be there, and it was very loud because everyone wanted to be part of a conversation. It had all the elements I love about WordCamps; handshakes between new friends, hugs between old friends, and huge transfers of information between everyone, it was fantastic. Aside from WordCamp Miami, it&amp;#8217;s also the largest WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended with 500 tickets sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was well-organized, by which I mean things were well planned for, and handled well when they didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Sessions were held in university class rooms. I think they were a little small for the number of attendees, but it didn&amp;#8217;t detract from the experience. Here&amp;#8217;s an example of a room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s Ramya Pandyan talking about being a better blogger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended where the sessions were in a variety of languages. I would expect this in a place like WordCamp EU, but to have it be a variety of &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; languages was fascinating to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unofficial time zone of India is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/04/28/india-journal-understanding-ist-indian-stretchable-time/&quot;&gt;Indian Stretchable Time&lt;/a&gt;. On the first day of WordCamp, Saurabh worked hard to keep things on schedule. We started 30 minutes late, but on Foundation Day, things got started an hour late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was full of people sitting and waiting patiently, but starting on time was &lt;strong&gt;not expected&lt;/strong&gt;. In the US, I would have expected a lot more cranky people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things were heavily guarded. The main venue was quite open, but to get into Foundation Day, I had to let these guys check me with a magnetic wand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48219&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png?resize=904%2C510&quot; alt=&quot;Indian Policemen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then 20 feet away sign in at a guard house, and then 30 feet beyond that show my ID inside the front door of the venue. This kind of thing also happened at restaurants and every time I went into my hotel. No-one was ever aggressive or suspicious, it&amp;#8217;s just something that happened and everyone took it in stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Word Lounge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48220&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png?resize=298%2C462&quot; alt=&quot;Word Lounge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There was a room set aside to be an all day open session for writers. There&amp;#8217;s a local group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlphabetSambar&quot;&gt;Alphabet Sambar&lt;/a&gt; (Sambar is a soup) that has a regular meetup to help each other with writing. They made sure to welcome attendees and keep a good discussion going all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this idea of unconference rooms based on topic. Some people thrive on the group communication that can come from that format, and I&amp;#8217;d love to see other topical open forums at other WordCamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The After Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of quiet after parties, so I can talk to people. I can also appreciate people wanting a pretty intense party atmosphere. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/crccpune&quot;&gt;Classic Rock Coffee Co.&lt;/a&gt; offered both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had three large areas, the largest being almost 6000 sq. ft., one about 800 sq. ft., and an ampitheater with seating for about 100 where they had live classic rock bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was a closed in area with seating for about 40 people that felt more like a cafe or restaurant. The larger open areas had a full bar and restaurant. Except for the cafe, the whole place had a fabric roof which is less sturdy than canvas. It had an outdoors feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at a table of about 15 people and had no trouble communicating with any of them. I was probably 130 feet from the music and it was well contained. I was able to communicate without noise being an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of people sat at tables, in the cafe, in the ampitheater; wherever they were most comfortable. It was probably my favorite after-party venue of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia#gallery-48212-1-slideshow&quot;&gt;Click to view slideshow.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bits and Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult thing for me was trying to discern people through their accents. Just about everyone had a solid handle on English, but there&amp;#8217;s a mental fatigue that comes from parsing the words through an accent. The longer you do it, the harder it gets, especially with sleep deprivation. I tried not to be rude, and people were patient with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a photo area with some crazy hats and people seemed to have a really good time with it. I can see it working at other WordCamps as well. The ladies from Hummingbird got one of me in a crazy hat, but I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48226&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png?resize=1025%2C578&quot; alt=&quot;Crazy Hat Picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was prepared on-site in realtime and it worked. It was mostly sandwiches, and the food prep people took a request, made the sandwich, and handed it to the person in moments. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have expected it to work that smoothly, but it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit and bottled water were available just about all the time, which was nice since it was pretty hot that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the food and language, this WordCamp didn&amp;#8217;t feel all that foreign to me. I suspect it&amp;#8217;s because WordCamps have a solid template for sessions, scheduling, etc. I enjoyed that, it enabled me to really take part in the event without having to stand to the side wondering what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers seemed to be on the ball and did a great job sharing the responsibilities, which I think is vital with a camp this size. The people were engaged, took full advantage of the options available to them, and &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; is what made it a successful WordCamp in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever get the chance to attend a WordCamp in a culture other than your own, I highly recommend you jump at the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Look Inside the Offices of 16 People Who Work With WordPress on a Daily Basis</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48204</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-look-inside-the-offices-of-16-people-who-work-with-wordpress-on-a-daily-basis</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a remote worker environment, people have the choice to work from home or wherever it&amp;#8217;s convenient. Syed Waseem Abbas published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://torquemag.io/inside-the-workplaces-of-16-wordpress-community-mavens/&quot;&gt;guest post on Torquemag,&lt;/a&gt; that looks at the offices of 16 people who work with WordPress on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the offices are classy while others are small. Many of the people featured in the post use one or more Apple products. If you&amp;#8217;re curious as to what my setup looks like, here you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48205&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg?resize=960%2C720&quot; alt=&quot;My Home Office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My Home Office
&lt;p&gt;Most of the work I do is on a Windows 7 Professional 64bit desktop PC with two 23-inch monitors. When I work remotely, I use a fully loaded 15-inch MacBook Pro with retina display from 2013. As a devoted Windows user, I feel like I&amp;#8217;m part of a dying breed, especially within the WordPress ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For WordPress Weekly, I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000PTF0E2&quot;&gt;Samson CO1U&lt;/a&gt; USB powered condenser microphone connected to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/musical-instruments/dp/B001D7UYBO/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442008126&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Rode+Swivel+mount&quot;&gt;Rode PSA1 swivel mount&lt;/a&gt; with a boom arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predominantly work in a sitting position which is why I&amp;#8217;m in the market for a standing desk where the height can be easily adjusted. I&amp;#8217;m also looking for a new office chair where the arm rests don&amp;#8217;t disintegrate within the first year of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions, let me know in the comments. Also, if you need inspiration to create the perfect office environment, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://officetoday.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Office Today&lt;/a&gt;. Office Today features remote offices and locations from across the world used by Automattic employees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: bbPress 2015 Survey Results Show Users Want Attachments, Better Moderation Tools</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48180</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/bbpress-2015-survey-results-show-users-want-attachments-better-moderation-tools</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The bbPress development team &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2015/09/2015-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;published the results&lt;/a&gt; of its 2015 survey. This year, 213 people participated which is 30 more &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2014/05/2014-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;than last year&lt;/a&gt;. After reviewing, replacing, and removing some questions from the 2014 survey, this year&amp;#8217;s survey has 25 questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of survey question types were used to gather the data including, multiple choices, check boxes, text fields, email box, and open‐ended questions. Empty forms were deleted and those marked as incomplete were reviewed individually. Submissions that had no responses on the second and third pages of the survey were excluded from the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highlights From the Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of respondents use bbPress 2.5 and above with WordPress 4.2 and above. Seventy-one percent of participants using bbPress &amp;lt;=1.x.x are also using the latest version of WordPress. This data indicates bbPress users are vigilant in keeping their sites up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of who uses bbPress, 51% of respondents use it on their own sites while 30% create sites with bbPress forums for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48182&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png?resize=485%2C249&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress 2015 Survey Users&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress 2015 Survey Who Uses bbPress
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, the top three languages used are English 74%, German 7%, and French 6.5%. Three-fourths or 75% of bbPress installations are within WordPress either in the domain root, physical directory, or physical subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining 25% are on multisite installations where more than half have activated bbPress network-wide and the rest in multiple networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48183&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg?resize=900%2C237&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress User Installations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress User Installations
&lt;p&gt;One statistic I&amp;#8217;m proud of is that 29% of the respondents found out about the survey through WP Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48184&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png?resize=854%2C328&quot; alt=&quot;How People Found Out About The Survey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The most wanted features in a bbPress theme are, Responsive (69.5%), Light and Fresh Design (52%), and Compatible with the latest bbPress version (49%). A preference for Responsive, mobile-first themes is in fourth place at 39%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, Attachments (42.5%), Ajaxification of Topics and Replies (41.5%), and Moderation tools in the front end (39%) are the most requested features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48196&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png?resize=463%2C219&quot; alt=&quot;2015 Most Requested Features&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2015 Most Requested Features
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of bbPress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercime, a BuddyPress and bbPress core contributor, confirmed at the end of the survey that the bbPress project is alive and well. According to Mercime, the development team is in the middle of a large migration project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/src/humans.txt&quot;&gt;bbPress core team&lt;/a&gt; has been involved in the process of migrating the WordPress Support Forums (English and all Rosetta sites) from bbPress 1.x.x to bbPress 2.5.8 starting with one European-language forums subsite which has been already ported and being tested on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this migration has been discussed many times and often over the years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;@johnjamesjacoby&lt;/a&gt; formally started the process when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/05/15/wp-org-forums-plugins-audit/&quot;&gt;posted the results of an audit&lt;/a&gt; to show the custom functionality required for a successful migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involves multiple teams including, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;WP Support team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/&quot;&gt;WP Meta Team&lt;/a&gt;. The migration will impact more than 8 million users on WordPress.org. Any improvements made to bbPress to ease the migration process are going to be merged back into the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Confirms It Did Not Have a Security Breach</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48173</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpml-confirms-it-did-not-have-a-security-breach</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When WPML emailed new &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext&quot;&gt;passwords to customers in plaintext&lt;/a&gt;, some customers thought it was due to a security breach. Amit Kvint, compatibility team leader for WPML, confirmed the emails are not a result of a security breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/2015/09/password-update-email-from-wpml/&quot;&gt;post on the official WPML blog&lt;/a&gt;, Kvint says the emails were a preventive measure to insure accounts remain secure, &amp;#8220;The main purpose and underlying principle for this action was making sure everyone has a good new strong password, we consider this an important step in online security,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvint acknowledges the improvements in WordPress 4.3 in how passwords are handled and admits that sending passwords in plaintext was not a good idea, &amp;#8220;The best practice would be, once the password is sent, to login and reset the password to a new strong one. We will definitely revise the way this is done in the future,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog post does not go into detail in how they determined passwords to be weak. To the best of my knowledge, WPML does not have a policy in place to enforce strong passwords. While no accounts were compromised, if some of the contacted customers choose a weak password, wouldn&amp;#8217;t it defeat the purpose of resetting passwords in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jetpack 3.7 Introduces a Simpler Interface, Adds Support for Development Sites</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48161</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-7-introduces-a-simpler-interface-adds-support-for-development-sites</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/2015/09/09/jetpack-3-7-simpler-ui-support-for-development-sites-and-more/&quot;&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt; and includes a simpler user interface, support for development sites, and fixes several issues with a variety of modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new interface separates some of Jetpack&amp;#8217;s functionality into categories such as, performance and security, traffic growth, and WordPress.com tools. The most commonly used modules are listed first with a link underneath that takes users to the other 27 modules and the old settings page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48162&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png?resize=968%2C492&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack 3.7 Interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack 3.7 Interface
&lt;p&gt;Turning a module on or off is accomplished by clicking a toggle. Services you need to pay for are clearly marked with links to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest drawbacks to Jetpack is switching between a local server or staging environment. If you move your site from one URL to another, Jetpack automatically detects the change and prompts the user to confirm if the URL is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48163&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png?resize=1025%2C155&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack on a staging site&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack on a staging site
&lt;p&gt;If Jetpack thinks two URLs are separate websites, it recommends that you create a new connection to prevent a service interruption on the original domain. The prompt has links to reset the connection, confirm that the URL is part of a development environment, or submit a trouble ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48164&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png?resize=1025%2C143&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites
&lt;p&gt;The VideoPress player in Jetpack 3.7 works on mobile devices thanks to its responsive redesign. Having VideoPress enabled allows you to easily embed VideoPress powered videos to your site by copying and pasting the video&amp;#8217;s URL into the visual editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other changes included in 3.7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to enable per-post opt-out for Subscriptions by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/support/subscriptions/#filters&quot;&gt;adding a filter&lt;/a&gt; to a functionality plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new Widget Visibility rule that allows you to show or hide widgets based on a page’s parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing buttons now display on bbPress forum posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; from the WordPress plugin directory. To view a list of all the changes in this release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/changelog/&quot;&gt;check out the changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Conceptual WordPress Plugin by Stephen Cronin That Makes Comment Moderation Easier</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48149</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-conceptual-wordpress-plugin-by-stephen-cronin-that-makes-comment-moderation-easier</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Moderating replies to comments in the backend of WordPress is tough. For example, WordPress 4.3 displays the reply and who it&amp;#8217;s in response too, but doesn&amp;#8217;t show the text of the parent comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t see the parent comment unless you open the author link in a new browser tab. This is not an optimal user experience and makes it more difficult to determine if the reply is from a spammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48150&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png?resize=851%2C161&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;Show Parent Comment&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Cronin, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/&quot;&gt;Scratch99 Design&lt;/a&gt;, is a potential solution to the problem. Simply activate and browse to the comment section of the WordPress backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show Parent Comment displays the text of the parent comment inside the reply. This helps moderators keep track of the conversation and helps to identify copy/paste spammers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48151&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png?resize=847%2C223&quot; alt=&quot;Show Parent Comment Plugin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easy Way to See The Parent Comment
&lt;p&gt;While the plugin works as advertised and shows the parent comment text, the interface needs to be improved. I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of the background color and some of the comment information is repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea is to replace the &lt;strong&gt;In Reply to Author&lt;/strong&gt; text to say, &lt;strong&gt;In Response To&lt;/strong&gt;. The show more or less button is a good idea but I think the text size needs to be increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Show Parent Comment is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;plugin directory for free&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s a proof of concept and is not officially supported by Cronin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept needs work but I think something similar needs to be added to WordPress core. As it stands, moderating comment replies is not a great experience and I think Cronin&amp;#8217;s plugin is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Emails Passwords to Affected Customers in Plaintext</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48123</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-31477&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png?resize=637%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Clear Text Password&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/thegloaming/1402099967/&quot;&gt;thegloaming&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;Customers who purchased &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/&quot;&gt;WPML&lt;/a&gt;, a multilingual plugin for WordPress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-699832&quot;&gt;are receiving&lt;/a&gt; a suspicious email that looks similar to a phishing attempt. Matt Radford, a customer of WPML, kindly sent the Tavern a copy of the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Matt&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure that your WPML account remains secure. For this, we are updating all client accounts with auto-generated strong passwords. A strong password helps prevent unauthorized use of your WPML account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our system will start the password update shortly. We will send you another email with your new password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WPML team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radford received a follow-up email that includes his new password in plaintext. WPML explains why the passwords were sent in plaintext, &amp;#8220;We detected weak passwords in our system and following this we are enforcing, on a one-time procedure, strong passwords to all our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As for sending them in plaintext, if you consider it not to be safe, please update your password in order to keep it secure,&amp;#8221; WPML said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When questioned if passwords are stored in plaintext within the database, WPML replied, &amp;#8220;As for storing passwords in our database we are not storing it in plaintext, we are using standard WordPress. Yes they&amp;#8217;re salted and hashed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise VanDeCruze, a WPML support forum moderator, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-700143&quot;&gt;the email was generated automatically&lt;/a&gt; from their systems. She confirms that sending passwords in plaintext is not a best practice and urges users to login to their accounts and generate a new password using the reset password link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This email was automatically generated by our system and sent to clients with passwords that were deemed too simple. However, sending new passwords in plain text via email without requiring user action is not best practice. I urge you to change your WPML account password. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were right to be cautious of this sudden email. Although it was not a phishing attempt, it was not the best way to ensure a safe password. In the future we will be mindful of adhering to strict security standards. Please let me know if you have any further questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WPML has not published any information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/blog/&quot;&gt;its blog&lt;/a&gt; that explains the situation and has yet to respond to our requests for comment. If you&amp;#8217;re a WPML customer and receive an email with a new password, you should immediately login and generate a new password using the site&amp;#8217;s reset password link and follow the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emailing passwords in plaintext is a terrible security practice. One of the key improvements in WordPress 4.3 is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/&quot;&gt;WordPress no longer emails passwords&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it sends password reset links that expire after 24 hours. In hindsight, WPML should have generated and sent password reset emails to affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Help Me Add Comment Approval Notifications to WordPress</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48059</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/help-me-add-comment-approval-notifications-to-wordpress</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy&quot;&gt;enabling comment moderation&lt;/a&gt; on the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;ve discovered that WordPress does not notify commenters when their comments are approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;m using the &lt;a title=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot;&gt;Comment Approved&lt;/a&gt; plugin by &lt;a title=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot; href=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot;&gt;Niels van Renselaar&lt;/a&gt;. It allows me to create a custom notification message that is sent when a comment is approved. Unfortunately, I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s working. Please let me know if you&amp;#8217;ve received any comment approval emails from the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe this feature should be in core. I&amp;#8217;ve started the process by creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717&quot;&gt;feature request ticket&lt;/a&gt; on WordPress trac. Let&amp;#8217;s discuss the pros and cons or why you think it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be in core. Please give me your feedback in the comments or within the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: How Chris Klosowski’s Lifestyle Changed by Writing One WordPress Plugin</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48051</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/how-chris-klosowskis-lifestyle-changed-by-writing-one-wordpress-plugin</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Klosowski, co-lead developer of Easy Digital Downloads, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kungfugrep.com/2015/09/how-writing-one-plugin-changed-my-lifestyle/&quot;&gt;explains how writing one plugin&lt;/a&gt; changed his lifestyle. He left his corporate job to be a full-time distributed worker and being a distributed worker comes with its own set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My truest challenge in this new lifestyle is knowing when it’s time to ignore Slack, shut off email, take off the Pebble, and just spend time with my family. It’s a challenge I’m learning to face, and the hardest part is admitting to myself that it’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s come up in conversation a couple times with my wife, and every time, she lets me know when I’m failing. Honesty here is the key. Not guilt, not anger, just brutal honesty of when I’m not being the best husband and dad because I’m putting work before them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges a distributed worker faces is figuring out the balance between work, family, and personal life. If you&amp;#8217;re struggling to find balance, I encourage you to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-mantra-of-family-comes-first&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and the nearly 100 comments that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments are from people in similar positions trying to figure out how to balance work, life, and family. After nearly three years of being a distributed worker, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Bug in Chrome 45 Causes WordPress Admin Menu to Break</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48045</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-bug-in-chrome-45-causes-wordpress-admin-menu-to-break</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Within the last five weeks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33199&quot;&gt;several people have reported&lt;/a&gt; an issue in Chrome that breaks the WordPress admin menu. If you hover the mouse cursor over menu items in the sidebar, they&amp;#8217;ll occasionally fall out-of-place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48046&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png?resize=764%2C543&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome WordPress Admin Menu &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using Chrome 45.0.2454.85, I&amp;#8217;m able to inconsistently reproduce the behaviour reported in the ticket. Through the process of elimination, users discovered Chrome is the software at fault and not WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179#c17&quot;&gt;source of the problem&lt;/a&gt; stems from Slimming Paint which is enabled by default in Chrome 45. Disabling slimming paint fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable this feature, visit &lt;strong&gt;chrome://flags/#disable-slimming-paint&lt;/strong&gt; in Chrome and &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Disable slimming paint&lt;/em&gt; option, and make sure the other two &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; options are disabled because they will override the Disable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds confusing, please refer to the following screenshot provided by Samuel Wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48056&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png?resize=839%2C185&quot; alt=&quot;Disable Slimming Paint Options&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Disable Slimming Paint Options
&lt;p&gt;Chrome&amp;#8217;s development team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179&amp;q=label%3AM-47%20slimming%20paint&amp;colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified&quot;&gt;aware of the issue&lt;/a&gt; and is working towards a solution that is marked for release in Chrome 47. Until then, users are encouraged to disable Slimming Paint until Chrome fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Dashboard Widget That Displays New Registered Users</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48037</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-dashboard-widget-that-displays-new-registered-users</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you run a WordPress site with user registration enabled and want to see recently registered accounts from the dashboard, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/new-user-dashboard/&quot;&gt;New User Dashboard Widget plugin&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/swadeshswain/&quot;&gt;Swadeshswain&lt;/a&gt;. After installing and activating the plugin, a new registered user widget appears on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48038&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png?resize=536%2C146&quot; alt=&quot;New Registered User Widget&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New Registered User Widget
&lt;p&gt;The widget tells you a user&amp;#8217;s registration date, name, and role. If you don&amp;#8217;t see the widget after activating the plugin, click on the Screen Options tab and make sure the box next to New User is checked. New User Dashboard Widget is the type of plugin that does one thing only and does it well. There&amp;#8217;s nothing to configure and it works out-of-the-box with WordPress 4.3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Proposal to Overhaul the Shortcode API in WordPress Goes Back to the Drawing Board</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48026</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/proposal-to-overhaul-the-shortcode-api-in-wordpress-goes-back-to-the-drawing-board</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/miqrogroove&quot;&gt;Robert Chapin&lt;/a&gt;, who contributes to WordPress core, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;published the first draft&lt;/a&gt; of a roadmap that explains how the Shortcode API could be overhauled. &amp;#8220;The decision to create this roadmap arose from specific needs that are not met by the old code,&amp;#8221; Chapin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has an aggressive timeline with development starting in WordPress 4.4 and ending in WordPress 4.7. In WordPress 4.4, a new syntax would be introduced that provides opportunities to make significant changes to the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of shortcodes that use the new syntax.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Self-Closing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode attr1=&amp;#8221;value1&amp;#8243; attr2=&amp;#8217;value2&amp;#8242; &amp;#8220;value3&amp;#8221; &amp;#8216;value4&amp;#8217; value5}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Enclosures&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${encl2}$] HTML [${encl3}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escaped Code&lt;/strong&gt;: [!{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the WordPress 4.5 development cycle, the focus would be to deprecate the old syntax, &amp;#8220;Plugins that register shortcodes without declaring support for new features will raise debugging errors to alert developers that support for the old shortcode syntax is ending,&amp;#8221; Chapin said. Posts using the old syntax would  continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the WordPress 4.6 update process, shortcodes using the old syntax would be converted to use the new syntax. The Shortcode API would continue to provide deprecated support for the old syntax to provide a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important point to note is that the new syntax does not support HTML inside of shortcode attributes. This leaves the potential for many sites to break as shortcodes may not perform the same way prior to WordPress 4.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition process ends with WordPress 4.7 where support for the old syntax is eliminated. Shortcodes and plugins that use the old syntax would stop working. During the WordPress 4.7 update process, a second attempt would be made to upgrade old content to use the new syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Proposal Raises Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has drawn constructive criticism from several members of the WordPress community. Nick Haskins, founder of Aesop Interactive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27426&quot;&gt;voiced his concern&lt;/a&gt; saying the syntax isn&amp;#8217;t easier for authors to use and will affect a large number of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://halfelf.org/&quot;&gt;Mika Epstein&lt;/a&gt;, who voluntarily moderates the WordPress.org support forums and interacts with users on a daily basis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27472&quot;&gt;sums up a list of concerns&lt;/a&gt; that many developers agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the plugins and themes on the planet we will break (because we will, they won’t read or test). We have to degrade them as gracefully as humanly possibly. Continuing to say “Well the developers were notified and should have updated” now that we’re as big as we are is not sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the very (legitimately) angry end users who are broken because they didn’t upgrade plugins and themes (or the themes/plugins didn’t get updated). People were rightly angry last time. It’s the end users, not the developers, who will be hardest hit by this change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating clearly to the users that it’s now &lt;code&gt;{{gallery}}&lt;/code&gt;. That’s going to be very hard. Incredibly hard. Updating their old posts (keeping in mind Justin’s Markdown caveat and those who use them as an aside – I know I know) is easier than making sure everyone knows what to do. At best we can keep tabs on the ones built into WP and perhaps use the logic we have in the visual editor NOW to convert them, but we have to figure out how to make sure everyone knows. This is nothing like the move of Menus to customizer. That was confusing, but the users could see what happened. This is a legit change, your old way is no longer going to work. That is huge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of users who have premium themes and plugins that &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; get update alerts. These people are simply not going to know they need to update and this is not their fault. We should never be breaking them if there’s possibly any alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users will be upgraded by their hosts vis-a-vis one-click installs and managed hosting so they will have up to date WP and out of date plugins/themes. So yes, many users will be on 4.7 and then a theme from 2014. It sucks, it’s the reality, we know it’s the reality, we cannot stick our heads in the sand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugins that are already using {{template}} tags in their code. Yeah, I’ve seen it. Most of them use it for search/replace within their own code, but we’ll want to make sure we check for everyone in the repo who might be doing it on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best argument against using the new shortcode syntax is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27518&quot;&gt;made by Stefano Agiletti.&lt;/a&gt; Agiletti says Italian keyboards don&amp;#8217;t have keys that create curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe English people don’t know that { and } are not present in all keyboards directly as the [ and ] are. On Italian keyboards [ and ] are generated using ALT-GR+è or ALT-GR++ and keyboards show ALT-GR basic sign like €@## and [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get { and } you need to type ALT-GR+SHIFT+è and ALT-GR+SHIFT++. Most people don’t know about this combination (I think only those who write code do) and the parentheses are not written on any key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the Drawing Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a considerable amount of feedback and concerns shared by developers, the proposal is heading back to the drawing board. In a comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27484&quot;&gt;summarizing the feedback&lt;/a&gt;, Andrew Nacin confirms that the new shortcode syntax does not fit the core team&amp;#8217;s vision of being easy and intuitive for non-technical authors to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he cautions that the team needs to do something, &amp;#8220;The proposed syntax significantly clashes with the proposed vision and given all of your feedback, we’re clearly going to have to go back to the drawing board. Please note that &lt;strong&gt;we still need to do something&lt;/strong&gt;, but maybe we can think further outside the box.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly encourage you to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;proposal and the comments&lt;/a&gt; that follow it. It&amp;#8217;s a great read that highlights how difficult it will be to make changes to the Shortcode API that don&amp;#8217;t end up causing a lot of sites to break.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48012</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who regularly comment on the Tavern may have noticed that your comments don&amp;#8217;t show up immediately after submitting them. That&amp;#8217;s because about four weeks ago, for the first time in the Tavern&amp;#8217;s history, comment moderation for all comments was enabled. I enabled moderation to address concerns raised by members of the community and to sleep better at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the request of a few readers and to be more transparent, I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/comment-policy&quot;&gt;comment moderation policy&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of at least a dozen people, I&amp;#8217;ve crafted a policy that is easy to read and more importantly, easy to follow. It explains our expectations, has a few tips on writing better comments, and lists possible reasons a comment may be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;&gt;CC0 licensed&lt;/a&gt; which is the least restrictive license offered by Creative Commons. Feel free to copy and modify it for your own use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strive to create a fun, friendly, and inviting atmosphere. The ground rules for commenting on WP Tavern are simple. Treat people the way you want to be treated. Try to understand someone else’s perspective and if you disagree, respectfully explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text is a difficult medium to decipher context. Emoticons and emoji help, but it doesn’t solve the problem. Take a deep breath and assume the commenter has the best of intentions before responding and approach discussions with open minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome different perspectives and viewpoints but we all need to clearly communicate them without tearing the opposition down in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay on point using concise language. If your comment is more than a few paragraphs long, consider publishing it on your own site instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your comment may be deleted if it matches any of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocates an illegal practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses vulgar, profane, or unnecessarily harsh language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is spam or appears to be written primarily to post a link or advertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is written anonymously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains copyrighted material not licensed for distribution on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impersonates another user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains an affiliate link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal insults, including those using racist or sexist terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines are not meant to be an exhaustive list. The deletion of comments is wholly within the discretion of the moderators at WP Tavern and we will err on the side of maintaining a safe and friendly community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;How Do I Report Comments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe a comment published on WP Tavern violates any of the listed guidelines or that you feel needs special attention, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/contact-me&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;. Please do not publicly report comments using social media such as Facebook or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form submissions are sent to authors with comment moderation capabilities. Include a link to the comment in your email with a short explanation as to why it needs our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to reestablish the comment section as a place where people feel welcome to voice their opinions without the fear of being ripped apart. We encourage criticism, disagreements, and open conversation but it needs to take place in a respectful manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: A Day of REST — a conference devoted to the WordPress REST API</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14173</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/a-day-of-rest-a-conference-devoted-to-the-wordpress-rest-api/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;A Day of REST&lt;/a&gt; will be the first ever event dedicated to the WordPress REST API. It&amp;#8217;ll happen on January 28th 2016, with a follow-on hack day on the 29th, and will be held at Bishopsgate Institute in London, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is aimed at developers who want to learn how to interact with the new WordPress REST API. From WordPress developers to Javascript developers, to application developers, A Day of REST promises to provide in-depth information that covers every aspect of the WordPress REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of event I&amp;#8217;ve been hoping to see in the WordPress community. Sessions will vary from an introduction to the WordPress REST API to in-depth case studies and guides on utilizing it in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an incredible and rare opportunity to learn from the people making the API and those extending it further than anyone else. A niche event to be sure, A Day of REST  is a big bet on the WordPress REST API &amp;#8212; which is not yet slated for core, but is widely expected to make it to core in the next few releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference is being organized to supply a clear demand for more information, resources, and education on the subject. At most WordCamps, REST API sessions seem to be some of the most crowded, with the most engaged and curious audiences. A Day of REST will be like those sessions, but much bigger, as the entire day will be dedicated to the single topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is speaking at A Day of REST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14179&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/speakers-day-of-rest-752x603.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;speakers-day-of-rest&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker roster consists of people who are building the WordPress REST API, and those who are already using it for production applications and websites. The speakers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan McCue &amp;#8211;  WordPress REST API co-lead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Hoyle &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Bachhuber &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen Vignos &amp;#8211; Director of Engineering, WIRED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K. Adam White &amp;#8211; Open Web Engineer, Bocoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Lenox &amp;#8211; Design Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Taylor &amp;#8211; Senior Engineer, New York Times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski &amp;#8211; Meta Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post Status will be an official partner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really pleased that Post Status will be the official content partner for A Day of REST. That means I’ll be attending the event, and I&amp;#8217;ll offer a number of in-depth posts related to the WordPress REST API, the sessions, interviews, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll also manage content for some of the larger event announcements, like this one. I&amp;#8217;ve known the organizers for a long time, and they are big supporters of Post Status. A Day of REST offers a really great opportunity for me to work with them and offer my readers some unique privileges and exclusive content for a subject that&amp;#8217;s of interest to most of my audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So who is organizing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14180&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/humans-752x333.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;humans&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/organizations/human-made/&quot;&gt;Human Made&lt;/a&gt;, who’ve brought on board &lt;a href=&quot;http://siobhanmckeown.com/about/&quot;&gt;Siobhan McKeown&lt;/a&gt; to lead the charge putting the event together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Made uses the API in a good bit of their services and product work, are really interested to see more adoption of the API, and are eager to provide education resources so that can happen. Those of you who pay close attention may know that two of Human Made&amp;#8217;s own are actually part of the team of four that does much of the REST API development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rmccue&quot;&gt;Ryan McCue&lt;/a&gt; is the project co-lead, and is generally steering the ship; the API started as his GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle&quot;&gt;Joe Hoyle&lt;/a&gt; is in day to day conversations for project direction and also commits a lot of code to the API; he is a co-founder of Human Made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hack Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 29th January 2016, there will be a WordPress REST API hack day. This event is being hosted by Mozilla Spaces in London. Space for the hack day is limited but the team would love for anyone interested to come along and help make the WordPress REST API. Bring a laptop and expect to get hacking. This event will be for building the REST API specifically, and not geared toward other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ticket details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/tickets/&quot;&gt;from the website&lt;/a&gt;. They’re £125 (+ VAT &amp;amp; booking fees) &amp;#8212; which ends up being around $235 US &amp;#8212; and the price includes all of the usual conference goodies: presentations, lunch, swag, and an informal afterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confirmed sponsors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is excited to already have some awesome sponsors on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prospress.com/&quot;&gt;ProsPress&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sucuri.net/&quot;&gt;Sucuri&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is also looking for more sponsors to get involved and help make this unique event happen. If you’d like to sponsor, send an email to events@humanmade.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the content, you can get updates either from this blog, or from the A Day of REST website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;feelingrestful.com&lt;/a&gt;. You should also follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/feelingrestful&quot;&gt;@feelingrestful&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for live updates. I&amp;#8217;ll have in-depth content and broader event information and the event site will have more general announcements, news, and event updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is quite accessible from much of the world, so I am hopeful and confident that there will be a diverse audience in attendance. I certainly look forward to visiting; and I was pleasantly surprised that it doesn&amp;#8217;t get as cold there as I thought; January temperatures (lows and highs) stay around the 40s (F, or 5-9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_default&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_unit_c&quot;&gt;°&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; C) &amp;#8212; which is likely warmer than it&amp;#8217;ll be where I live in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is an exciting development in the WordPress conference ecosystem and I&amp;#8217;m confident it&amp;#8217;s going to be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Envato Implements Item Support Policy for ThemeForest and CodeCanyon</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47990</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/envato-implements-item-support-policy-for-themeforest-and-codecanyon</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In August of 2014, Envato &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/news/item-support-sustainability-authors-clarity-buyers/&quot;&gt;announced a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; that would allow sellers on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codecanyon.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;CodeCanyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;ThemeForest&lt;/a&gt; to inform buyers whether or not an item is supported. Earlier today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/releases/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/&quot;&gt;Envato implemented&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;Item Support Policy&lt;/a&gt; for sellers on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When browsing items on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, a blue badge indicates the seller provides support. There&amp;#8217;s also a badge and text that informs potential buyers if an item is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47991&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png?resize=639%2C408&quot; alt=&quot;This Item is Supported&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This Item is Supported
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt;, buyers automatically receive six months of support from the date of purchase. If you need support for an entire year, you can buy an extension for a nominal upgrade fee. Envato takes 30% and gives 70% of the purchase to authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of a &lt;b&gt;6-month support extension&lt;/b&gt; for a &lt;b&gt;Regular License&lt;/b&gt; is calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37.5% of the item price (30% of the list price) when purchased at the same time as the license;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;62.5% of the item price (50% of the list price) when purchased during the support period; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87.5% of the item price (70% of the list price) when purchased after the support period has ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Freeman, product manager for Envato, says the changes provide a standardized definition of support, &amp;#8220;Buyers will know exactly what to expect from all purchases on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers who purchased supported items before the new policy went into effect have six months of free tech support starting on September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disgruntled Authors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.envato.com/t/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/3619&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; with over 165 responses, sellers discussed the pros and cons of the policy while some expressed anger. &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/user/jonathan01&quot;&gt;Jonathan Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr3ativ.com/&quot;&gt;Cr3ativ&lt;/a&gt;, who sells several items on ThemeForest, thinks the policy is not as good as alternatives offered outside of the marketplaces because of its confusing complexity for both authors and buyers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure why Envato chose this solution when we already have a well established support/upgrade system in place within most of the WordPress community where 12 months of support is included in the purchase and customers receive a 50% discount to continue receiving support and updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is a work in progress, &amp;#8220;We will be monitoring the impacts of this change very closely and will be tweaking, improving and enhancing the support tools over coming weeks and months,&amp;#8221; Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a buyer or seller on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, let us know what you think of the support policy in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Twenty Sixteen Now Available on GitHub and the WordPress Theme Directory</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47973</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/twenty-sixteen-now-available-on-github-and-the-wordpress-theme-directory</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen, the default theme scheduled to ship with WordPress 4.4, is available for download on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/&quot;&gt;WordPress theme directory&lt;/a&gt;. According &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/29/twenty-sixteen-is-now-on-github/&quot;&gt;to Tammie Lister&lt;/a&gt;, Twenty Sixteen will be developed as if it were a feature plugin and will merge into WordPress core later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development takes place on GitHub, changes will regularly sync up to the WordPress theme directory. By installing and activating Twenty Sixteen from the theme directory, users can easily update to new versions as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Twenty Sixteen has 23 issues and 27 pull requests on GitHub. Many of the issues such as, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/pull/23&quot;&gt;introducing automated Travis CI build testing into Twenty Sixteen,&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/labels/discussion&quot;&gt;up for discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the top half of the Tavern looks like with Twenty Sixteen activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47974&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=1025%2C563&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the content section looks like. Notice the block of code that displays instead of an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47976&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=881%2C648&quot; alt=&quot;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen Activated
&lt;p&gt;Testers are encouraged to open issues and pull requests on GitHub. If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with how GitHub works, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; explains how to contribute to the Twenty Sixteen project. Keep in mind that Twenty Sixteen is a work in progress and should not be used in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Great jazz cover of one of my favorite Kendrick Lamar songs, Rigamortis, which of course is inspired by the great jazz song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=27&amp;v=TstRwZygLAo&quot;&gt;The Thorn by Willie Jones III&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress.com Unveils the Action Bar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47954</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-unveils-the-action-bar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/new-action-bar/&quot;&gt;unveiled a new user interface&lt;/a&gt; called the Action Bar. It&amp;#8217;s a bar that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen for logged in users and is accessible from any device. The bar performs multiple tasks depending on the page you&amp;#8217;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47955&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png?resize=1025%2C627&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Action Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress Action Bar
&lt;p&gt;When on a WordPress.com powered site that you&amp;#8217;re not following, the bar turns into a Follow button. Clicking the follow button will notify you of new posts published on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47956&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png?resize=192%2C60&quot; alt=&quot;Action Bar Follow Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Action Bar Follow Button
&lt;p&gt;If you click the three dots to the right, you&amp;#8217;ll see a variety of options depending upon the page you&amp;#8217;re viewing. If it&amp;#8217;s the homepage, you&amp;#8217;ll see links to download the theme the site uses, report the content, or manage the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re browsing a specific post on a WordPress.com site, you&amp;#8217;ll see an additional link to copy a shortlink for quick and easy sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47957&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png?resize=265%2C319&quot; alt=&quot;Easily Share Posts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easily Share Posts
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com and are logged in, the Follow button turns into a Customize button. This link provides a quick way to enter the Customizer. There&amp;#8217;s also an Edit link if you&amp;#8217;re browsing a published post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47958&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png?resize=307%2C348&quot; alt=&quot;Edit and Customize Links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Edit and Customize Links
&lt;p&gt;If the action bar is too big and you want to minimize it, click the three dots and select the option to Collapse the bar. It will shrink the bar into squares and get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the action bar is the ability to quickly see and download a theme used on a WordPress.com site. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for WordPress.com specific sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailypost.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The Daily Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What annoys me about the action bar is that it disappears when I scroll down. I caught myself scrolling down to read a post and when I looked for the edit button to fix a typo, the action bar was gone. I think it should stay on the screen at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to see the Edit link in the action bar open a front-end editor. It&amp;#8217;s time WordPress.com step up its game and stop forcing users through a backend interface to edit published content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the experimental action bar but at the same time, I question the reasoning for adding yet another user interface element to mimic actions already supported by other buttons and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, between the admin bar, dashboard, the edit link underneath a post, and the action bar, there are now four different ways to edit a post. How many roads are necessary to reach the same destination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com, let me know what you think of the action bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.3.3 Patches Security Vulnerabilities in BuddyPress Messages Component</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47948</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-3-patches-security-vulnerabilities-in-buddypress-messages-component</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-41978&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=828%2C265&quot; alt=&quot;BuddyPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3&lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2015/08/buddypress-2-3-3/&quot;&gt; is available&lt;/a&gt; and users are encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;update as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. A few security vulnerabilities were discovered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/buddypress-components-and-features/#internal-messaging&quot;&gt;BuddyPress Messages, &lt;/a&gt;a core component that allows users to send and receive private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to the BuddyPress team that could allow members to manipulate a failed private outbound message and inject unexpected output to the browser. The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof Katowicz-Kowalewski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the first vulnerability, the BuddyPress core development team independently discovered and fixed related vulnerabilities with the messages component that could allow for carefully crafted private message content to be rendered incorrectly to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3 also fixes a couple of bugs in the 2.3 codebase and improves support for backend changes made in WordPress 4.3. To protect your sites from these vulnerabilities, you should perform a full backup and &lt;strong&gt;update BuddyPress as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Theme Review Team Begins Phasing Out Favicon Support</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47940</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-begins-phasing-out-favicon-support</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main features in WordPress 4.3 are Site Icons. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icon&lt;/a&gt; is an image that represents a website across multiple platforms and replaces Favicons. With Site Icons in WordPress core, the WordPress Theme Review team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;phasing out the feature&lt;/a&gt; in existing themes hosted in the theme directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;p&gt;Justin Tadlock, a theme review admin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;published a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to provide a backwards compatible experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tadlock, the easiest method is to check if the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; function exists. This tells you if the user is running WordPress 4.3 and has the site icon feature available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check if the user has set up a new icon using the core WordPress feature by using the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; conditional tag which returns either &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some example code from the tutorial you can use to handle the check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ( ! function_exists( 'has_site_icon' ) || ! has_site_icon() ) {

    // Output old, custom favicon feature.
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional information, I encourage you to read&lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/wordpress/development/backwards-compatibility-site-icons/&quot;&gt; Stephen Cronin&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; which goes into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Theme Review Team enforces a guideline where features added to core are phased out of themes within two major releases. By the time WordPress 4.5 is released, theme authors will be able to remove legacy code without disrupting the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A survey or application form will soon be published which will result in a pool from which the attendees will be invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit is a rare opportunity for members of various contributor teams to focus and work together in the same physical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual WordPress Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use, build, or make a living with WordPress, please take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2015&quot;&gt;annual survey&lt;/a&gt;. Results will be shared during Matt Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation at WordCamp US. The more people who fill out the survey, the more representative the data will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation from 2014 to see results from the previous survey.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Stream Is Shutting Down Its Cloud Data Storage October 1st</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47925</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/stream-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-data-storage-october-1st</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/introducing-stream-3/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt; and includes some significant improvements. Stream is a WordPress plugin that tracks changes to a site similar to an audit trail. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service&quot;&gt;version two was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, it morphed from a plugin to a service. Activity logs were stored in the cloud which lessened the amount of resources used on local webservers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version three will no longer store data in the cloud. Instead, it will store activity logs locally. The cloud service provided by Stream 2 is closing on &lt;strong&gt;October 1st&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives users a little more than a month to migrate data from the cloud to their local webserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cloud is Expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Carbis, lead developer of Stream, says the time frame was chosen based on a number of factors, &amp;#8220;We chose a 6 week migration window as a balance between bleeding cash and doing the right thing by our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s also helpful to remember that the vast majority of our users are on a Free plan, which only includes 12 weeks of storage. We are monitoring the accounts of each of our paid users and I&amp;#8217;m personally making sure that every one of them has migrated,&amp;#8221; Carbis told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move away from the cloud is largely based on cost. The majority of Stream&amp;#8217;s customers signed up to the free plan with a significant lack of interest in the Pro Subscription. Server costs were also higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XWP to The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lack of income from Stream 2 and acquisition talks failing, Carbis was contracted to do outside work leaving Frankie Jarrett the only person working on the project. Stream&amp;#8217;s investor decided to pull the plug on the project at the same time Jarrett decided to resign from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I heard that Frankie had resigned I gave him a call. We reminisced on our achievements, and threw around some of our ideas on what could have been. That conversation renewed my inspiration. I jotted down some notes, and that’s when things started to turn around,&amp;#8221; Carbis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members from &lt;a href=&quot;https://xwp.co/&quot;&gt;XWP&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to lend a helping hand and the project is now officially under the XWP umbrella. This allows Stream to remain free and open source. The partnership will also facilitate add-on, connectors, and adapters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New in Stream 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is rewritten from the ground up. Activity logs use half the space in the database compared to Stream 2. It supports multisite through the use of Network Admin and uses a dependency injection model to be more extendable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Stream 3 includes a variety of improvements two notable features have been removed, Notifications and Reports. If you depend on these features, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/stream-3-faq/&quot;&gt;review the following FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbis and XWP are taking Stream into a new direction. Stream&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wp-stream/roadmap/&quot;&gt;proposed roadmap&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub and Carbis encourages users to not only review it, but to contribute to the project&amp;#8217;s future, &amp;#8220;I’d like to see Stream’s users contribute more to its direction. Contribution isn’t limited to ideas either. If you can design, develop, or translate, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wp-stream/stream&quot;&gt;contributing to the Stream project&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if Stream can regain the momentum it lost after transitioning to a cloud based system to store data. Now that Stream stores activity logs locally again, those in the EU should be able to use it without breaking privacy laws. Stream is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; on the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Akismet: Quantifying Reddit Bigotry</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1859</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/08/27/quantifying-reddit-bigotry/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2015-08-30): It looks like the team who created the tool decided to retire it due to some reported accuracy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never pass on the opportunity to mix in a little bit of humor with our passion for web content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our engineers, Dan Walmsley, participated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedyhackday.org/la-2015&quot;&gt;Cultivated Wit&amp;#8217;s Comedy Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles last weekend, and his team&amp;#8217;s resulting project has since surfaced on &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-tool-quantifies-reddit-bigotry&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/26/reddit-bigotry-check/&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeredditcheck.com/&quot;&gt;Free Reddit Check&lt;/a&gt;, created by Dan&amp;#8217;s team and crowned with the day&amp;#8217;s top prize, is a site which attempts to quantify the terribleness of Reddit users based on their public comment content and subreddit participation. While perfectly suited for a hack day which pairs developers and comedians, there is certainly usefulness in determining the respectability of a potential online acquaintance. Or just knowing who to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being obsessed with content analysis, community moderation, and keeping the web&amp;#8217;s underbelly in check, we can&amp;#8217;t help but think it&amp;#8217;s a nifty idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1859&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 205 – Interview With Miriam Schwab</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47915</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-205-interview-with-miriam-schwab</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode of WordPress Weekly, I&amp;#8217;m joined by Miriam Schwab, founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://illuminea.com/&quot;&gt;Illuminea&lt;/a&gt;, a web development company based in Israel. She’s also on the Steering Board of &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitaleveisrael.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Eve Israel&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leading communities for professional women in Israel to help empower women economically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab explains her WordPress origin story, what it&amp;#8217;s like to live in Israel, and how active the WordPress community is in her area. She shares her thoughts on the future of WordPress and warns that if it doesn&amp;#8217;t improve the user experience, it will drive users away to competing platforms. At the end of the interview, she tells us her favorite plugins that she installs on most of her client sites.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: First Look at the Twenty Sixteen Default WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47897</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.4 is the last scheduled major release of the year and with it will come a new default theme to replace Twenty Fifteen. On the Make WordPress Core site, Tammie Lister &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/25/introducing-twenty-sixteen/&quot;&gt;published an image gallery&lt;/a&gt; that shows off the design of Twenty Sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lister, the process of determining the new default theme has taken months, &amp;#8220;Lots of themes were considered, eventually settling on the one you see below. It’s a perfect fit,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47898&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png?resize=433%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen
&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen is designed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi&quot;&gt;Takashi Irie,&lt;/a&gt; who also designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2013/12/13/twenty-fourteen-wordpress-3-8-parker/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fourteen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2015/03/19/twenty-fifteen-the-wordpress-default-theme-for-2015/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; default themes. Irie describes Twenty Sixteen as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modernized approach of an ever-popular layout — a horizontal masthead and an optional right sidebar that works well with both blogs and websites. It has custom color options that allow you to make your own Twenty Sixteen. The theme was designed on a harmonious fluid grid with a mobile first approach. This means it looks great on any device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theme has hints of Twenty Fourteen but is different enough to stand on its own as a unique design. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look as modern as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; out-of-the box but the design could change during the 4.4 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help Twenty Sixteen be the best it can be, please join the weekly meetings held every Monday and Friday at 16:00 UTC in the #core-themes channel on &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt;. The meetings are a half hour-long and start once the theme is initially added to WordPress core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think of Twenty Sixteen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: OSTraining Makes Pods Framework Video Training Series Available for Free</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47885</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/ostraining-makes-pods-framework-video-training-series-available-for-free</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-40653&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg?resize=628%2C290&quot; alt=&quot;pods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/&quot;&gt;OSTraining&lt;/a&gt;, a site that offers video training for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and other technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/blog/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;http://pods.io/&quot;&gt;Pods Framework&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;training series&lt;/a&gt; is now available for free. Steve Burge, founder of OSTraining.com, says offering the video series for free is the result of a partnership with the Pods Framework project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This project came about because the OSTraining and Pods teams bumped into each other on a regular basis. I often ran into Jim True and Josh Pollock from Pods. We met at WordCamps and WordPress meetups in Tampa, Orlando, and Miami, FL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Pods team explained that they were working on improving their documentation. They started a YouTube series, wrote tutorials, and started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/pods-lead-developer-scott-kingsley-clark-launches-friends-of-pods-funding-campaign&quot;&gt;Friends of Pods&lt;/a&gt; initiative to support their efforts. Making the videos free is our way of contributing to the Pods project,&amp;#8221; Burge told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burge recorded the series after using Pods to create the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appalachiantrail.com/&quot;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt; website. The series provides an introduction to Pods, templates, creating a custom taxonomy, and more. Those interested can view the series on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;OSTraining.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk9dCVMQRmSptuJ6YdVzMkr5&amp;v=4rm95kNxRXg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a look at the first video in the series which introduces viewers to the Pods Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was created in 2014, the series contains great insight into the project and provides an educational foundation for learning Pods 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Request: Alex King Rememberances</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=22017</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear WordPress community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apologies for the selfish and personal nature of this post. I hope you will forgive me given the circumstances. As most of you know, I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as &amp;#8220;dad&amp;#8221;, but when she gets older she&amp;#8217;ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent more than a decade in the WordPress community and I&amp;#8217;d like to request that you to share a few thoughts or remembrances about me that we can compile and share with her when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have crossed paths or if I have managed to do something that you found helpful, I&amp;#8217;d love it if you would take a few minutes to write it down and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/contact&quot;&gt;send it to me&lt;/a&gt; or my wife: heatherkingcom@gmail.com. If you&amp;#8217;re willing to have the story shared publicly, please indicate that accordingly. By default, we will keep everything confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the thread: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; an ongoing story on this site. View the thread timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Step Up Your Game: How to Work With Successful WordPress Clients</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47868</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/step-up-your-game-how-to-work-with-successful-wordpress-clients</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47869&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Mario Y. Peshev&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Ryan Hellyer&quot; href=&quot;http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mario Peshev&lt;/a&gt;. Mario is the founder and WordPress Architect at &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/p9TnMSFMi2&quot;&gt;DevriX&lt;/a&gt; building and maintaining large WordPress-driven platforms. With over 10,000 hours of consulting and training, Mario&amp;#8217;s Yin and Yang is his Open Source advocacy and business growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning &amp;#8211; Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47879&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png?resize=682%2C281&quot; alt=&quot;Step up your game featured image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58522126@N00/430932479&quot;&gt;Stairwell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a learnaholic for as long as I can remember and when I read the aforementioned quote, it resonates strongly with me. My prelude to WordPress years ago was one of the steps toward improvement and success and I’ve developed a special love-hate relationship with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utmost admiration about its influence over the world in terms of Open Source and opportunities for various people in different niches, and its plague of being diminished and depreciated by professional developers and successful businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to solve these issues as long as the inner circle works towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are happy building lego type websites with random ThemeForest themes and you see that as your future, this post is not for you. If you love doing the same repeatedly for mom and pop shops, this may not resonate with you. This is applicable to people who want to get better at what they do, be more professional, and make some impact by solving complex problems for larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress For a Better Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, I presented at a conference focused on kids and teenagers to motivate them, prepare them for the adult life, and nurture their creativity. Kids these days hardly think about their future, between their teenage emotional dramas and boring homework assignments. If you think about it, how can they be passionate about becoming someone if they have no real idea what they need to know and do on a daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used WordPress as an example of a platform that children can use, one that provides them with the opportunity to develop a talent or passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using WordPress for homework and general notes (or a diary) could indicate interest in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young bloggers can potentially do creative writing or copywriting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly switching themes and playing with colors might open the room to design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding plugins and trying to implement complex combinations is the first step to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing posts, looking at analytics and comparing different titles or photos is the way to marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other potential areas of course, but as long as kids can associate with an activity, become passionate about it, and start digging into it, they can save years of slacking, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars on college degrees for specialties they couldn’t care less about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why more and more people join the WordPress industry and switch boring jobs in order to make a living off of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Types Of WordPress Services Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of opportunities for WordPress work is incredible but the vast pool of WordPress jobs is so vague and blurry, that hiring and educating talent is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep an eye on dozens of job boards, portals, and freelance networks. Clients look for Virtual Assistants to get their websites built. They look for expert WordPress developers to apply content changes to their site or web designers to develop complex plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis I see references to WordPress administrators, programmers, developers, designers, marketers, digital artists, webmasters, VAs, and plenty of other job titles used improperly. As a matter of fact, I’m now fascinated when I see a WordPress related job post or an offer looking for the right type of candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news is that you can do anything with WordPress. The caveat here is that WordPress itself is not a skill. You don’t ask for an Internet expert nowadays and you don’t go to the same doctor when you have a headache or you’ve injured your leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide industry of innocent clients and amateur service providers have made it nearly impossible to tell a developer from a marketer, or from a general user who has installed WordPress with an auto-installer twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Indecent World of WordPress Experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-39089&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Job Titles Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/5565517971&quot;&gt;I love &amp;#8217;84&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a lot about impostor syndrome in several reputable WordPress blogs, and people keep identifying themselves in the comments. In my opinion, this is a problem so insignificant as compared to the ever-growing pool of people claiming to be WordPress Experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last several years, I’ve interacted with people all around the world working with WordPress. From freelancers to successful business owners at conferences, and from beginner virtual assistants to full-stack consultants in social media, blogs and job networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of service providers that I’ve found is the one of &lt;em&gt;WordPress experts&lt;/em&gt;. You can easily substitute expert with specialist, guru, master, ninja and rockstar. Just open a new tab and do a few quick searches in Google, job networks, social media and view the large number of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list are &lt;em&gt;WordPress developers&lt;/em&gt;. A WordPress developer is often described as people who install plugins. There are various possible scenarios, but this is rarely the definition of an actual developer proficient in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some boards or blogs list specific skills that let you filter by programming language or a separate tool. My latest research with 200 contractors with WordPress developer titles led to 170 people who rate themselves with 4 or 5 out of 5 stars in PHP proficiency, and 30 with 3 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 170 people in the first group, 150 were college students, Internet marketers, VAs, and people who have substituted strings in WordPress themes thanks to support forums or help from the Codex. Not a single line of code was written from scratch, let alone building anything, and 4 out of 5 or higher self-assessed their level of PHP experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom McFarlin &lt;a href=&quot;http://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-developers-programmer-implementer/&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the difference between a developer and implementer and I wrote an overview defining &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-job-titles-dont-mean-much-anymore&quot;&gt;various technical skills in the WordPress context&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the lack of proper training, any official educational resource or meaningful set of skills per role, both finding talent and improving one’s skills is being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge you to interview several successful clients around you who looked for skillful WordPress folks. They either happened to know the right people, were recommended someone, ended up with several freelancers who messed up big time, went AWOL and suddenly took the cash and disappeared, couldn’t deliver, or they did and the site is incredibly slow and/or got hacked soon thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s sending serious businesses away and I won’t touch the topic of under pricing services and products which brings the quality and support way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivates people to use a reliable resource in order to grow? The WordPress Foundation, nor any of the big players provide official training curriculum, and a definition for formal roles. There is no WordPress certification program (I won’t get into that to avoid unnecessary discussions), and there are no clear paths for requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WordPress Community is Filled with Amateurs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, our community is a large group mostly composed of amateurs who started using WordPress one way or another. These people started earning money and reached a point where they don’t know where they stand, what they’re proficient in, if they’re doing fine, whether they’re experts, impostors, or somewhere in the middle, and what would be helpful to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still use FTP and work with PHP 5.2-supported hosts. The most popular theme marketplaces provide products with broken and inconsistent code. The WordPress.org plugin repository accepts plenty of plugins with suspicious consistency and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these issues are recognized publicly in the WordPress community. Some hosts prohibit SSH and allow solely FTP. PHP 5.2 will be supported by Core for a while, which doesn’t motivate hosts to upgrade. Marketplaces earn millions from their top sellers, so they’re not interested in quickly bringing up quality as long as poorly coded themes sell well. There’s also no formal constantly reviewed plugin repository for high quality plugins and no one is actively backing this idea up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the last paragraph as a rant, it’s because it is. It’s meant to be a “wake up call” to clients who don’t know better and service providers who want to become better. While the WordPress Core itself is incredibly stable and flexible, the rest of the infrastructure is mostly poorly coded due to under pricing, lack of skills, and lack of more successful clients interested in backing up WordPress teams and consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of people and plenty of applications of WordPress. Whatever you do, it’s your professional duty to offer the right type of service instead of misleading your clients, and be aware of the other pertinent verticals. Moreover, it’s the only way forward working with reputable organizations and large profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a Successful Client?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-32204&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png?resize=636%2C278&quot; alt=&quot;Success Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeveeaar/2035597695/&quot;&gt;seeveeaar&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige Conference&lt;/a&gt; happened a few weeks ago, and Shane Pearlman from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tri.be/&quot;&gt;Modern Tribe&lt;/a&gt; shared his experience in a presentation entitled, Land the Big Fish: Strategies Acquiring Larger Clients. It’s a motivational talk that outlines different strategies on negotiating and landing larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the session, Pearlman is asked, “What’s in it for me to go through all of that headache to procure bigger brand names?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated at the beginning, working with successful clients is not for everyone. Some people are afraid to leave their comfort zone. Others are too lazy to learn new skills or sometimes doing the same thing repeatedly may be their perfect job. For every other entrepreneur or business player, successful clients are exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each small change is magnified when working with successful clients. Usually, they have a lot of employees, a solid budget for marketing and advertising, a lot of traffic, and various complex requirements that help them attract more leads or automate their processes. T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hey are often respectable and have access to more capital. This allows them to invest more since their return of investment is worth it; while taking a risk due to saving a few bucks could very well ruin their reputation and harm their business. There are several examples of products or companies in the WordPress community that were hacked or where updates caused major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with successful clients is extremely rewarding and exciting, but getting there requires ace skills and solid experience, as well as the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Target Successful Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience with banks, telecoms, automotive, airline brands, large educational institutions and media outlets over the last 12 years as a developer and a technical lead, there are several specific areas where courageous WordPress freelancers and small business owners can focus on if they are aiming for growth and successful clients, but aren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have identified some steps for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/08/8-steps-to-move-from-freelancer-to-successful-company/&quot;&gt;moving from a freelancer to a successful company&lt;/a&gt;. Here is what we should focus on in the WordPress context in order to step up our game, understand our industry better, and start acting professionally if we want to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress is a Vague Term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a WordPress Expert says nothing. You may be a lead developer of WordPress or someone who can memorize the order of all submenus under Settings in the admin dashboard. Both are classified as WordPress experts and that’s what many people don’t realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialize in a given niche and polish your skills. Focus on a specific group of projects &amp;#8211; membership websites, eCommerce stores, multisite installs. Become a know-it-all professional for an extensible plugin such as, BuddyPress, Gravity Forms, or Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the value you are providing and what it corresponds to. Be respectful to the broad community of professionals in your area, learn from them, ask them to be your mentors. Even the best athletes and CEOs have coaches, business mentors, and boards of directors. Find out what it is that you do whether it’s design, development, marketing, or something else and learn the skill inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Installments Don’t Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people offer WordPress services as an add-on to their portfolio of other services without realizing the impact it has on the business. While WordPress is used for plenty of purposes, it’s still a technical platform that comes with its own specific set of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what will happen if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a vulnerable plugin that is exploited and your client’s password is stolen, along with their private details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You forget to protect the media uploader and the client uploads sensitive data. Scanned images of contracts and ID cards end up in the public space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your sitemap plugin indexes protected data since you used a plugin that doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a site and sell it to a client, and due to the terrible choice of plugins, the site crashes miserably and kills the server during a demonstration in front of their big clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a small list of what ifs, but they happen all the time. If you don’t possess the skills or offer the wrong service, this could damage your client’s business. Upping your game and providing solutions instead of websites allows you to take care of the infrastructure, maintenance work, support, development, security, marketing of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, be aware of the consequences and partner up with other agencies and consultants. Complete packages are what successful clients look for and inexperienced people often mess up what others have built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Expert Skills Won’t Cut It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients look for professional skills. They have real problems that can’t be solved with yet another plugin, and they are smart enough to know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the business of configuring themes and installing a few plugins for clients, that won’t do it for successful customers. You need to specialize in code, design, user experience, marketing, or something else that brings real value to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large clients are looking for state of the art designs, performant and secure code, brilliant marketing skills, and growth hacking strategy. Large clients are successful because they are outstanding at what they do, the services they offer, and they appreciate high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context-Specific WordPress Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations take their marketing presence and technical stack seriously. They carefully delegate based on multiple factors. Being in a meeting with a large client typically means discussing a use case together with several people such as, a creative director, VP of marketing, network engineer, and project manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being skillful in your niche and ready to provide value, you have to learn the business processes of your target client. Your idea of a solution may be applicable for small sites, but it may very well be a bad fit based on the company policy or the variety of services used by the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, a creative director may require you to prepare your theme to be ADA Section 508 compliant, which is an accessibility standard required by certain organizations. The VP of marketing may ask for a Hubspot integration with Cvent within your website for proper CRM and meeting request management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network engineer could outline that they need to host the solution on-site, and set up a specific set of web application firewalls and internal web server security rules restricting certain process callbacks. The project manager might share a complicated timeline based on the organization load, holiday schedule, decision maker’s availability, conferences, and various deliverables that need to be presented by different people and other third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are things that we’ve been asked for over the past few months. If you are used to working with a specific host using Apache, prepare for writing documentation and shipping to a restricted server running HHVM. If you use a framework that isn’t accessible, you will need to step back, explore the Section 508 standards, and build something compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic solutions are often not the right fit for large clients. But if you’re determined to learn more and become a better professional, that’s the perfect challenge for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solving More Complex Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to adjust to different environments, working with large clients means solving more complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a mom and pop shop is somewhat broken or down, it’s probably not a big deal if their site receives 100 visits per month. But for a project with tens of millions of views a month and thousands of concurrent users, it is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on larger and heavy platforms often means dealing with a lot of data, complex relationships, and solid traffic. This means that every single line of your code and business decision will inevitably impact the entire system in a way visible to hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to cope with these, you should study your specialty in detail and understand what the impact is of every single change. These skills increase your value and let you face similar challenges and solve problems that the majority of beginners can’t even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn a lot about the entire stack, and get to know hundreds of different rules. At some point you will voluntarily violate those rules, being aware of the fact that some design patterns and best practices don’t solve specific problems. It’s better to denormalize a database or minify a compression algorithm in order to solve a business problem for a large platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just as they say at a music college &amp;#8211; you learn the music theory for three years, and then you throw everything away and start playing jazz. You need to know the entire architecture and strategy first in order to decide how to optimize it in the best possible manner, whether it’s using a best practice or violating one for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaming Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have worked solo or in a small team, you will eventually need to partner up or grow. Either way, large projects are time consuming and require different expertise, and it’s unthinkable for one to know it all. Therefore, you will work with other professionals from more industries, team up and solve more complex problems together, and learn more about their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have thought about mastering a single skill, teaming up with the right people will add a few more skills as an extra perk, which will increase the potential of your main skill as well. Working with financial analysts on a project for a bank helped me to understand the entire model of loans and mortgages, as well as the internal banking policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to learn how loans and interests work in different cases and get acquainted with standardized security regulations at companies in the financial field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-44224&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png?resize=688%2C368&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Security Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/8264582@N06/3383392046&quot;&gt;Two Locks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy and security are important topics that people often misjudge. Working with large clients means more responsibility and higher impact in case of a problem. In the process of building a solution or consulting a reputable organization, you will most likely have to comply with various security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of them may seem unnecessary, there is a reason they exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better it is for you, your clients, and future endeavors. If you’re not using VPNs, SSH keys, two-factor authentication, or voice recognition IDS, this may be a good lesson for you. Why are they needed, what problems do they solve, and how can you apply them to your personal data and existing set of clients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization and Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47877&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg?resize=620%2C400&quot; alt=&quot;BrainyQuote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BrainyQuote
&lt;p&gt;In order to be helpful to large businesses as a consultant, or an agency, you need to be reliable. This may be a result of a number of testimonials, successful track record at previous companies or a good portfolio. It’s always challenging to start with large customers, so improving your skills and working hard in order to become valuable is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being organized and process-oriented is essential to most reputable organizations. The majority of them are more conservative and operate slowly, since a minor mistake could cost them millions or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rely on detailed specifications, scope of work documents, use case diagrams, UX mockups/wireframes, E/R diagrams, and a large list of documents. They include every single detail in their planning &amp;#8211; from holidays for each member of their team, to different dependencies from other service providers and third-party members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients have managed to build a process and scale it in a way that grows their revenue in a predictable way. In order to be able to handle large projects, you need to treat them as a small project that takes longer to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use a project management system and version control properly, define your pricing strategy, make sure to predict all of the delays for both communication and payments. Learn how large organizations operate and do your due diligence upfront in order to avoid surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take anything for granted and don’t assume anything. The more confident you are, the higher the possibility of making a major mistake. There are always new automatic deployment strategies or a DevOps service you haven’t heard of, another massive CSS3 grid, or a growth hacking strategy that you haven’t explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more challenges you face, the more you’ll learn, and be able to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Personal WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=21662</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/22/personal-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve forked the FavePersonal theme to release a few changes that I&amp;#8217;ve made to it for my own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improved Gallery feature, including support for WordPress shortcode galleries. If you&amp;#8217;re uploading photos directly to your gallery post, you can use drag and drop to set the order for them now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Post Formats admin UI is now responsive and works great on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the Social plugin from the theme (requested by WP.org) &amp;#8211; it can still be installed separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make tons of misc. code changes to match new coding standards vs. previous coding standards (and pass the theme check).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/maine-gallery-510x469.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gallery&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-22028&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally hoping to have the modified theme hosted on WordPress.org but after weeks of waiting for review, they responded that features of the theme like &lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24520#comment:4&quot;&gt;choosing colors and post formats&lt;/a&gt; should be done in separate plugins instead. This makes no sense to me as these are core features of the theme, but happily there are great places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that will host the project for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Personal theme is quite assuredly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?url=alexking.org&quot;&gt;mobile-friendly&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it a great fit for the importance Google&amp;#8217;s is placing on mobile-friendly sites lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub or, for you technically minded, grab the reop with git. Just make sure to also grab the submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:alexkingorg/wp-personal.git&lt;br /&gt;
cd wp-personal&lt;br /&gt;
git submodule update --init --recursive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/project/personal&quot;&gt;Personal Theme&lt;/a&gt;. View the project timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.3.1 also fixes twenty-six bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.3.1">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.3/?rev=34199&amp;stop_rev=33647">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.3.1</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.3.1.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.3 make it even easier to format your content and customize your site.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>

It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.3:</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard.

<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>The Team</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

	<title>Akismet: Akismet WordPress Plugin 3.1.4</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1873</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/09/24/akismet-3-1-4-wordpress/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Version 3.1.4 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the Akismet plugin for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; is now available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update clarifies the error messages that Akismet uses so that they&amp;#8217;re easier to understand, and it enables link previews in the admin for all links in a comment &amp;#8212; not just the author&amp;#8217;s website link. A fix is also included for a bug that could have caused comment moderation emails to be sent for some comments that were caught as spam.  For a full list of the changes in this release, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/akismet/trunk&quot;&gt;revision log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions. If you need to download the plugin zip file directly, links to all versions are available in &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the WordPress plugins directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1873&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WP Comment Humility Relocates the Comments Top-level Menu Item to the Posts Menu</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48313</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-comment-humility-relocates-the-comments-top-level-menu-item-to-the-posts-menu</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-billie-named-after-jazz-singer-billie-holiday-is-available-for-download&quot;&gt;features in WordPress 4.3&lt;/a&gt; is that comments on pages are disabled by default. If you only enable comments for posts, you may be interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;WP Comment Humility&lt;/a&gt;, a new plugin created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;John James Jacoby&lt;/a&gt; that moves the top-level Comments menu item to the Posts menu. The following screenshot better illustrates what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48314&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png?resize=429%2C378&quot; alt=&quot;Comment Humility in Action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Comment Humility in Action
&lt;p&gt;If a site enables comments for posts only, this location for the menu item makes sense. What if you&amp;#8217;re using Custom Post Types? According the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/faq/&quot;&gt;plugin&amp;#8217;s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, the user experience might be weird, &amp;#8220;If you have a post type other than &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; that supports comments, it may make more sense to not use this plugin,&amp;#8221; Jacoby said. He suggests giving it a try and if the user experience doesn&amp;#8217;t feel right, to disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/stuttter/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;located on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; where you can also submit Pull Requests. WP Comment Humility works out-of-the-box without any configuration options on WordPress 4.3 and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; in the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Highlights From Matt Mullenweg’s Q&amp;A Session on Product Hunt</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48303</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/highlights-from-matt-mullenwegs-qa-session-on-product-hunt</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;On September 22nd, Matt Mullenweg participated in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;question and answer session&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. Product Hunt is a site &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;that lets users share and discover new products. In the session, Mullenweg answers questions like what advice he&amp;#8217;d give to his 20 and 25-year-old self and how he combats burn out. Here are a few highlights from the session.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nikhil V&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Hello Matt, with the upcoming release of the WP REST API in WordPress core, what do you hope to most see built with its capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m hugely excited about the REST API! Once the infrastructure is in, I think we&amp;#8217;ll see really widespread adoption from plugins that right now are creating their endpoints in very ad-hoc ways. Once we iterate a bit more on the core content endpoints and authentication I think we&amp;#8217;ll see a lot more specialized interfaces built on WP as like a content kernel, an engine powering a wide array of applications and interfaces you&amp;#8217;d never imagine having WordPress behind them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erik Torenberg &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;If you could go back in time and give advice for your, say, 20-year-old self, what would you tell yourself? How about 25?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; To my 20-year-old self I would say to be okay with things building up over time. Something I didn&amp;#8217;t appreciate until recently is that there any many productive decades ahead with which to build the things that I feel need to exist in the world. One of the best things I did then was avoid any press or capitalization on my age (to the extent I could) because youth is an ephemeral asset and just a novelty in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my 25-year-old self I would tell him to slow down and think about health more, I burned the candle at both ends that year. I would also say to not get as caught up in mailing list and IRC arguments and discussions, just focus on building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sydney Liu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In the early days of WordPress, what was the 20% that got you the 80% of the results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; There&amp;#8217;s no simple answer there, if I had to pick one thing it would be &lt;em&gt;luck&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Kristof Bernaert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; How do you see WP about 5 years, or how do you want it to see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In 5 years I think that WP will be infinitely easier to use for both power-users, developers, and newbies. You will be able to have a full experience of core, plugins, themes, docs, and support in several dozen languages that will be as large or larger than English. There will be over a million people making their living on top of the platform. Most people will be creating from touch devices, and their content will mostly not come from keyboards (virtual or physical) as an input device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Tys Bradford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;&amp;#8211; Your accomplishments with WordPress have literally changed the face of the internet and enabled people without programming skills to make beautiful and functional websites. Do you think this could be replicated ever with mobile applications (iOS/Android)? I have seen a few companies try, but none have come close to delivering in the way WordPress is able to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Thank you! The ecosystems and app stores for iOS and Android right now are too locked down, and the discoverability and overhead of apps is too distorted, for an approach like WordPress&amp;#8217; to work for mobile applications. The environment for the foreseeable future there is going to favor more centralized apps, my only hope is that at least a few get really successful (including ours) that aren&amp;#8217;t advertising-driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Question Was Not Answered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my question was not answered. However, I&amp;#8217;m going to ask it in this post with the hope that he&amp;#8217;ll answer it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve spent a lot of time, money, and energy trying to create a great mobile experience in WordPress via dedicated apps. As more of the WordPress backend becomes responsive, how will this affect (if any) the priority level of developing the mobile apps versus putting that time and effort into a 100% responsive WordPress backend?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullenweg answers a lot more questions than what&amp;#8217;s listed above but those are the ones that stand out to me. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;read the entire session&lt;/a&gt; on the Product Hunt site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress REST API Is One Major Step Closer to Being Merged Into Core</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48284</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-rest-api-is-one-major-step-closer-to-being-merged-into-core</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After more than three years of development, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://v2.wp-api.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress REST API&lt;/a&gt; is one major step closer to getting merged into core. Ryan McCue, a lead contributor to the project, published the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;official proposal&lt;/a&gt; to merge the API into WordPress. The proposal explains what the REST API is, why it&amp;#8217;s needed, an integration plan, and what happens after the merge. The plan is to integrate the API in two stages, infrastructure and endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Part Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure is the code responsible for routing requests and handling the meta layer of the API, including JSON serialization/deserialization, linking, embedding, and REST best practices. Merging the infrastructure first allows developers to start building upon it and to migrate from existing custom code. The plan is to merge the infrastructure portion of the API in WordPress 4.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endpoints are considered the more complex of the two as they’re responsible for mapping data from the external JSON format to the internal data structures and vice versa. In other words, endpoints are the bridges of communication between WordPress and external applications. To provide more time for core committers to review the code, endpoints will be merged in WordPress 4.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of the API &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API&quot;&gt;takes place on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; but core WordPress development takes place on Subversion and Trac. When the API is merged into core, it will no longer be developed as a separate project. McCue proposes that the best of GitHub and Trac be integrated so developers comfortable with GitHub can continue to contribute to the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the team’s experience with GitHub as well as Trac, we can bring the best of both worlds by helping integrate the two. This would also improve contributions to WordPress as a whole, and benefit the whole community. This will be especially important as we encourage more contributions from the wider community (client authors, for example). We think we can make good progress here, and we’d love to try to help improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress&quot;&gt;GitHub repository for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;s synced to its Subversion counterpart, it does not accept pull requests. If integrating GitHub and Trac proves to be successful, it could open the door for WordPress to accept pull requests or contributions through GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan to merge the API into core is not finalized and the team needs your &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;comments, questions, and opinions&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage you to read the full proposal and the comments as McCue answers additional questions related to the merge. How happy are you to see this merge proposal?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The Impacts HeroPress Is Having on WordPress Communities in India</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48286</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-impacts-heropress-is-having-on-wordpress-communities-in-india</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Topher DeRosia, who recently attended&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia&quot;&gt; WordCamp Pune&lt;/a&gt;, India, &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/subtle-impacts/&quot;&gt;published a post on the HeroPress blog&lt;/a&gt; that describes the subtle impacts the project is having on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saurabh Shukla, lead organizer for WordCamp Pune, says the site inspired not only their speaker selection but their presentations as well, &amp;#8220;We wanted people to derive at least a level of inspiration from the speakers and decided that stories make more sense than presentations,&amp;#8221; Shukla said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of inspiring presentations at WordCamp Pune include, a workshop where people could experience accessibility issues for themselves, WordPress for activism, and building education products for South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Presentation in a Classroom at WordCamp Pune
&lt;p&gt;According to DeRosia, many Indians feel like their WordPress communities are not getting the respect they deserve. DeRosia believes the amount of excitement expressed by Indians for HeroPress is because their work is noticed and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;That&lt;/em&gt; is why India is excited about HeroPress. They’re getting respect. Not just from me, but from thousands of readers around the world,&amp;#8221; DeRosia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although DeRosia says he&amp;#8217;d be content with the impacts the site has had if HeroPress ended today, I would be sad to see it go  because it&amp;#8217;s a great addition to the WordPress community. Thankfully, DeRosia says people are requesting more essays, exchanges of knowledge, shared wisdom, shared respect, and more of the HeroPress spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an essay published on HeroPress or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;project&amp;#8217;s mission&lt;/a&gt; has inspired you in any way, please let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Interview, and Complementing Slack</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45326</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/09/complementing-slack/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.me/tonyconrad&quot;&gt;Tony Conrad&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strictlyvc.com/&quot;&gt;StrictlyVC&lt;/a&gt; event in San Francisco last week, following a dizzyingly talented line-up of &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/chamath-palihapitaya-on-insane-burn-rates-ipos-and-raising-a-new-real-estate-fund/&quot;&gt;Chamath Palihapitiya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dfj.com/content/steve-jurvetson&quot;&gt;Steve Jurvetson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/18/move-over-slack-automattic-mulls-commercializing-its-own-internal-messaging-product/&quot;&gt;Techcrunch has a good write-up with a number of the relevant quotes from the event&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing I&amp;#8217;d like to respond to, because it wasn&amp;#8217;t a direct quote, is the headline &amp;#8220;Move Over Slack? Automattic Mulls Commercializing Its Own Internal Messaging Product.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem is the headline missed the obvious alliteration of &amp;#8220;Mullenweg Mulls,&amp;#8221; &lt;img src=&quot;http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f600.png&quot; alt=&quot;😀&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;but more importantly&amp;#8230; &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; has become a really key tool for both Automattic &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;and WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt; and anything we do with the evolution of &lt;a href=&quot;http://p2theme.com/&quot;&gt;P2&lt;/a&gt; (some of which we already have running internally) will be complementary to Slack, not competitive with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jeff Yablon and the WordPress Foundation Settle Out of Court</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48267</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jeff-yablon-and-the-wordpress-foundation-settle-out-of-court</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation sued Jeff Yablon&lt;/a&gt; for trademark infringement. The Foundation wanted Yablon to stop using its trademarks, dismiss the opposition proceeding, pay the foundation for any profits related to use of the WordPress trademarks, pay up to $100,000 per infringing domain name, transfer the domains and pay other fees and damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline of Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 22nd, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=7&quot;&gt;Yablon filed a request&lt;/a&gt; for default judgement. On June 29th, the Foundation responded to Yablon by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=8&quot;&gt;asking the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board&lt;/a&gt; to deny Yablon&amp;#8217;s request for default judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 9th, David Mermelstein, Administrative Trademark Judge, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=9&quot;&gt;filed a response&lt;/a&gt; that not only denied Yablon&amp;#8217;s motion for default judgment, but also suspended proceedings until the civil case was complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With proceedings suspended, Yablon could no longer file motions or requests with the TTAB. The only option left was to proceed through court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Settlement Between Yablon and The Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 21st, Yablon and the WordPress Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudup.com/cLmq3DWS6MZ&quot;&gt;settled out of court&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48277&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png?resize=839%2C621&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of Settlement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sample of Settlement
&lt;h3&gt;Yablon&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the settlement, by no later than October 15th, Yablon agrees to cease any and all use of the WordPress name, logos, trademarks, and any other name or mark confusingly similar to the term WordPress or its logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also has to cease any and all use of the WordPress Marks, standing alone or in combination with other words or designs, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use in any company name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta-tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personalized URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyword Advertising on Yablon&amp;#8217;s websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media handles or account names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indoor outdoor store signage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letterhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stationary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon must also comply with the terms of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/&quot;&gt;WordPress trademark and domain name policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No later than five days after the effective date (Oct 15th), Yablon has to transfer all of the domains he owns that incorporate the WordPress Mark to the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Yablon acknowledges that the Foundation owns and has the exclusive rights in and to the WordPress marks in connection with the goods and services identified in each of WordPress&amp;#8217; registrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon can no longer do anything inconsistent with the Foundation&amp;#8217;s ownership of its WordPress Marks and registrations thereof, including but not limited to, contesting the Foundation&amp;#8217;s title to or the validity of the WordPress marks or the trademark registrations thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WordPress Foundation&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Yablon transfers the domains to the Foundation and does not breach the terms of the agreement, the Foundation will redirect the domains to a domain of Yablon&amp;#8217;s choosing for 6 months from the effective date or April 1, 2016, whichever comes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 10 days of the domains being transferred, the Foundation will file a stipulated request to withdrawal its U.S. Opposition Proceeding No. 91221895 without prejudice and Case 3:15-cv02745 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, without prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as Yablon does not breach the agreement, the Foundation agrees not to sue for violating its trademarks prior to the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation will not object to Yablon&amp;#8217;s use of the WordPress Marks as part of any subdomains or subdirectories associated with any second level domain name registered to and controlled exclusively by Yablon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples include but are not limited to, wordpress.answerguy.com or answerguy.com/wordpress in connection with services that involve use of the WordPress platform, support the WordPress brand services, and that do not otherwise violate the rights of the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parties agree to bear their own attorney&amp;#8217;s fees and costs, if any were incurred through the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;spoke to Yablon&lt;/a&gt; on the phone in June shortly after the lawsuit was filed, he sounded like he knew what he was getting into and the complexities involved with U.S. Trademarks. Yablon strongly believed he had enough evidence to pursue the matter and to see it through the court system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing the court case all the way through, he chose to give up which in the court system, is not the same thing as losing, as losing or winning sets a precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Yablon didn&amp;#8217;t lose the case, the WordPress Foundation didn&amp;#8217;t win either. It&amp;#8217;s a reminder that the Foundation will aggressively defend its trademarks in the court system if other means prove unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think Yablon’s mission to defend his use of WordPress in a top-level domain name and potentially open the door for others to do the same, was in the best interest of the WordPress community as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;Gravity Flow&lt;/a&gt; is one of the coolest new plugins I&amp;#8217;ve seen in quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoices, purchase orders, job applications, and employee vacation requests are just a few potential applications for Gravity Flow, which makes form-centric approval, user input, and notification processes simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With Gravity Flow, you use the power of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; to design your forms, and you use Gravity Flow to design your process using easy to use drag-and-drop tools,&amp;#8221; the video states. The flows created in Gravity Flow can be customized to include all sorts of user-defined paths to request stakeholder feedback, get administrative approval, or fire off a notification that a certain step in the flow has been accomplished. It can even be integrated with other notification systems like Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that common to see a WordPress plugin (especially an add-on plugin) that simultaneously targets a niche and serves it so extensively. Gravity Flow is built to extend the powerful Gravity Forms product, and it really takes it an extra mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of potential for Gravity Flow for intranets and other corporate environments with lots of stakeholders and traditionally clunky, email based workflows for approval of common tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trying Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took Gravity Flow for a spin, because there is a handy demo site capability built in. For a plugin this complex, being able to test drive it is a really great feature. Most workflow tasks can take place either in the admin or on the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating workflows feels a lot like adding regular notifications to Gravity Forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14340&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-workflow-752x579.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workflows have many configuration and sending options. And each step can be sorted and arranged to follow a series of steps, and can even allow for delays (like for a scholarship review period, in my example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s the view for an administrator, but someone who is responsible for providing feedback or approval has a front-end view to directly interact with the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14339&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-review-update-workflow-752x872.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-review-update-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;872&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And administrators can see reports of activity for various workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14338&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-reports-752x552.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-reports&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;552&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty simple overview of the plugin, and I&amp;#8217;d recommend you &lt;a href=&quot;http://demo.gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the demo&lt;/a&gt;, or his full &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.gravityflow.io/category/34-walkthroughs&quot;&gt;walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; examples. but this at least highlights some of the plugin&amp;#8217;s power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Development of Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting things about Gravity Flow is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Henty&lt;/a&gt; made it. Steven actually works at Rocketgenius, the company behind Gravity Forms, and he is a developer of the main Gravity Forms product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to Steven about why this isn&amp;#8217;t a Gravity Forms official add-on, and what it&amp;#8217;s like working on a side project for your own company&amp;#8217;s product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocketgenius has a lot of plans and loads of really exciting stuff in the pipeline so it was a question of priorities &amp;#8211; Rocketgenius can’t possibly do absolutely everything at the same time. For me it’s a project that’s niche enough to be an interesting and profitable side project and yet not too time-consuming so I can continue to focus 100% on my day job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterated how important it is to him that he had his team behind him for this project. And Carl Hancock &amp;#8212; co-founder of Rocketgenius &amp;#8212; is excited about Steven&amp;#8217;s product as well, saying &amp;#8220;The product is awesome. It&amp;#8217;s definitely more complex [and] business oriented, but that&amp;#8217;s a good thing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl also shared that Steve has a background that lends itself to thinking about complex problems to solve, working on, &amp;#8220;more enterprise stuff pre-WordPress, on a wide variety of platforms and programming languages.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve did a great job with Gravity Flow, and I&amp;#8217;m happy to see it out there.  On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/gravity-flow/&quot;&gt;his personal blog&lt;/a&gt;, he highlights use cases for the product, which are real world examples based on how his first 100 beta testers are using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gravity ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Rocketgenius employees have Gravity Forms focused side projects, which I think is really cool. Another favorite of mine is David Smith&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://gravitywiz.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Wiz&lt;/a&gt;, that adds functionality snippets, or &amp;#8220;perks&amp;#8221;, to Gravity Forms. The third-party ecosystem is doing well too; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityplus.pro/&quot;&gt;Gravity Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityview.co/&quot;&gt;Gravity View&lt;/a&gt; are two healthy Gravity Forms focused businesses that come to mind, and I&amp;#8217;m sure there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main plugin continues to dominate the WordPress forms space. Though it is commercial only, it powers hundreds of thousands of websites, and has dozens of official &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/&quot;&gt;add-ons&lt;/a&gt;. Carl has told me many times he doesn&amp;#8217;t even view most other WordPress forms plugins as competition (though newer entrants like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ninjaforms.com/&quot;&gt;Ninja Forms&lt;/a&gt; are doing quite well for themselves), as Gravity Forms aims to take marketshare away from complex hosted solutions like Wufoo, rather than gobble up the much larger but less demanding market that just wants simple contact forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up with Gravity Flow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the website&lt;/a&gt;. And the project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stevehenty/gravityflow&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt; as well, as Steve is billing for support and automatic upgrades, which starts at €87 (around $100) per year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems like the longest days are those in between an Apple announcement and when the products are actually available. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to iOS 9, WatchOS 2, 6s+, Apple TV&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Recap of WordCamp Pune, India, by Topher DeRosia</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48212</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48213&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; href=&quot;http://topher1kenobe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Topher DeRosia&lt;/a&gt;. Topher has contributed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe#content-plugins&quot;&gt;number of plugins&lt;/a&gt;, spoken at many WordCamps, and is the lead of documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://easydigitaldownloads.com/&quot;&gt;Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/a&gt; He also operates &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/&quot;&gt;HeroPress.com&lt;/a&gt; on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last July, the lead organizer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pune.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Pune, India &lt;/a&gt;asked if I would come and speak about HeroPress. This post isn&amp;#8217;t going to be about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;HeroPress&lt;/a&gt; nor about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/category/wordcamp/pune/&quot;&gt;my adventures on the trip&lt;/a&gt;. No, this post is going to be about a WordCamp in a relatively large city in India, how it compares to American WordCamps, and some things that were experimented with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Similarities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, WordCamp Pune is exactly like every other WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve been to. The night before the event, there was a speaker dinner with excellent food and wonderful company. Registration was chaotic because WiFi was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone was happy and excited to be there, and it was very loud because everyone wanted to be part of a conversation. It had all the elements I love about WordCamps; handshakes between new friends, hugs between old friends, and huge transfers of information between everyone, it was fantastic. Aside from WordCamp Miami, it&amp;#8217;s also the largest WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended with 500 tickets sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was well-organized, by which I mean things were well planned for, and handled well when they didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Sessions were held in university class rooms. I think they were a little small for the number of attendees, but it didn&amp;#8217;t detract from the experience. Here&amp;#8217;s an example of a room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s Ramya Pandyan talking about being a better blogger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended where the sessions were in a variety of languages. I would expect this in a place like WordCamp EU, but to have it be a variety of &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; languages was fascinating to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unofficial time zone of India is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/04/28/india-journal-understanding-ist-indian-stretchable-time/&quot;&gt;Indian Stretchable Time&lt;/a&gt;. On the first day of WordCamp, Saurabh worked hard to keep things on schedule. We started 30 minutes late, but on Foundation Day, things got started an hour late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was full of people sitting and waiting patiently, but starting on time was &lt;strong&gt;not expected&lt;/strong&gt;. In the US, I would have expected a lot more cranky people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things were heavily guarded. The main venue was quite open, but to get into Foundation Day, I had to let these guys check me with a magnetic wand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48219&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png?resize=904%2C510&quot; alt=&quot;Indian Policemen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then 20 feet away sign in at a guard house, and then 30 feet beyond that show my ID inside the front door of the venue. This kind of thing also happened at restaurants and every time I went into my hotel. No-one was ever aggressive or suspicious, it&amp;#8217;s just something that happened and everyone took it in stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Word Lounge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48220&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png?resize=298%2C462&quot; alt=&quot;Word Lounge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There was a room set aside to be an all day open session for writers. There&amp;#8217;s a local group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlphabetSambar&quot;&gt;Alphabet Sambar&lt;/a&gt; (Sambar is a soup) that has a regular meetup to help each other with writing. They made sure to welcome attendees and keep a good discussion going all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this idea of unconference rooms based on topic. Some people thrive on the group communication that can come from that format, and I&amp;#8217;d love to see other topical open forums at other WordCamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The After Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of quiet after parties, so I can talk to people. I can also appreciate people wanting a pretty intense party atmosphere. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/crccpune&quot;&gt;Classic Rock Coffee Co.&lt;/a&gt; offered both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had three large areas, the largest being almost 6000 sq. ft., one about 800 sq. ft., and an ampitheater with seating for about 100 where they had live classic rock bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was a closed in area with seating for about 40 people that felt more like a cafe or restaurant. The larger open areas had a full bar and restaurant. Except for the cafe, the whole place had a fabric roof which is less sturdy than canvas. It had an outdoors feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at a table of about 15 people and had no trouble communicating with any of them. I was probably 130 feet from the music and it was well contained. I was able to communicate without noise being an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of people sat at tables, in the cafe, in the ampitheater; wherever they were most comfortable. It was probably my favorite after-party venue of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bits and Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult thing for me was trying to discern people through their accents. Just about everyone had a solid handle on English, but there&amp;#8217;s a mental fatigue that comes from parsing the words through an accent. The longer you do it, the harder it gets, especially with sleep deprivation. I tried not to be rude, and people were patient with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a photo area with some crazy hats and people seemed to have a really good time with it. I can see it working at other WordCamps as well. The ladies from Hummingbird got one of me in a crazy hat, but I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48226&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png?resize=1025%2C578&quot; alt=&quot;Crazy Hat Picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was prepared on-site in realtime and it worked. It was mostly sandwiches, and the food prep people took a request, made the sandwich, and handed it to the person in moments. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have expected it to work that smoothly, but it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit and bottled water were available just about all the time, which was nice since it was pretty hot that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the food and language, this WordCamp didn&amp;#8217;t feel all that foreign to me. I suspect it&amp;#8217;s because WordCamps have a solid template for sessions, scheduling, etc. I enjoyed that, it enabled me to really take part in the event without having to stand to the side wondering what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers seemed to be on the ball and did a great job sharing the responsibilities, which I think is vital with a camp this size. The people were engaged, took full advantage of the options available to them, and &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; is what made it a successful WordCamp in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever get the chance to attend a WordCamp in a culture other than your own, I highly recommend you jump at the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Look Inside the Offices of 16 People Who Work With WordPress on a Daily Basis</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48204</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-look-inside-the-offices-of-16-people-who-work-with-wordpress-on-a-daily-basis</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a remote worker environment, people have the choice to work from home or wherever it&amp;#8217;s convenient. Syed Waseem Abbas published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://torquemag.io/inside-the-workplaces-of-16-wordpress-community-mavens/&quot;&gt;guest post on Torquemag,&lt;/a&gt; that looks at the offices of 16 people who work with WordPress on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the offices are classy while others are small. Many of the people featured in the post use one or more Apple products. If you&amp;#8217;re curious as to what my setup looks like, here you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48205&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg?resize=960%2C720&quot; alt=&quot;My Home Office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My Home Office
&lt;p&gt;Most of the work I do is on a Windows 7 Professional 64bit desktop PC with two 23-inch monitors. When I work remotely, I use a fully loaded 15-inch MacBook Pro with retina display from 2013. As a devoted Windows user, I feel like I&amp;#8217;m part of a dying breed, especially within the WordPress ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For WordPress Weekly, I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000PTF0E2&quot;&gt;Samson CO1U&lt;/a&gt; USB powered condenser microphone connected to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/musical-instruments/dp/B001D7UYBO/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442008126&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Rode+Swivel+mount&quot;&gt;Rode PSA1 swivel mount&lt;/a&gt; with a boom arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predominantly work in a sitting position which is why I&amp;#8217;m in the market for a standing desk where the height can be easily adjusted. I&amp;#8217;m also looking for a new office chair where the arm rests don&amp;#8217;t disintegrate within the first year of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions, let me know in the comments. Also, if you need inspiration to create the perfect office environment, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://officetoday.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Office Today&lt;/a&gt;. Office Today features remote offices and locations from across the world used by Automattic employees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: bbPress 2015 Survey Results Show Users Want Attachments, Better Moderation Tools</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48180</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/bbpress-2015-survey-results-show-users-want-attachments-better-moderation-tools</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The bbPress development team &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2015/09/2015-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;published the results&lt;/a&gt; of its 2015 survey. This year, 213 people participated which is 30 more &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2014/05/2014-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;than last year&lt;/a&gt;. After reviewing, replacing, and removing some questions from the 2014 survey, this year&amp;#8217;s survey has 25 questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of survey question types were used to gather the data including, multiple choices, check boxes, text fields, email box, and open‐ended questions. Empty forms were deleted and those marked as incomplete were reviewed individually. Submissions that had no responses on the second and third pages of the survey were excluded from the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highlights From the Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of respondents use bbPress 2.5 and above with WordPress 4.2 and above. Seventy-one percent of participants using bbPress &amp;lt;=1.x.x are also using the latest version of WordPress. This data indicates bbPress users are vigilant in keeping their sites up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of who uses bbPress, 51% of respondents use it on their own sites while 30% create sites with bbPress forums for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48182&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png?resize=485%2C249&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress 2015 Survey Users&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress 2015 Survey Who Uses bbPress
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, the top three languages used are English 74%, German 7%, and French 6.5%. Three-fourths or 75% of bbPress installations are within WordPress either in the domain root, physical directory, or physical subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining 25% are on multisite installations where more than half have activated bbPress network-wide and the rest in multiple networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48183&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg?resize=900%2C237&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress User Installations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress User Installations
&lt;p&gt;One statistic I&amp;#8217;m proud of is that 29% of the respondents found out about the survey through WP Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48184&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png?resize=854%2C328&quot; alt=&quot;How People Found Out About The Survey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The most wanted features in a bbPress theme are, Responsive (69.5%), Light and Fresh Design (52%), and Compatible with the latest bbPress version (49%). A preference for Responsive, mobile-first themes is in fourth place at 39%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, Attachments (42.5%), Ajaxification of Topics and Replies (41.5%), and Moderation tools in the front end (39%) are the most requested features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48196&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png?resize=463%2C219&quot; alt=&quot;2015 Most Requested Features&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2015 Most Requested Features
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of bbPress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercime, a BuddyPress and bbPress core contributor, confirmed at the end of the survey that the bbPress project is alive and well. According to Mercime, the development team is in the middle of a large migration project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/src/humans.txt&quot;&gt;bbPress core team&lt;/a&gt; has been involved in the process of migrating the WordPress Support Forums (English and all Rosetta sites) from bbPress 1.x.x to bbPress 2.5.8 starting with one European-language forums subsite which has been already ported and being tested on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this migration has been discussed many times and often over the years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;@johnjamesjacoby&lt;/a&gt; formally started the process when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/05/15/wp-org-forums-plugins-audit/&quot;&gt;posted the results of an audit&lt;/a&gt; to show the custom functionality required for a successful migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involves multiple teams including, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;WP Support team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/&quot;&gt;WP Meta Team&lt;/a&gt;. The migration will impact more than 8 million users on WordPress.org. Any improvements made to bbPress to ease the migration process are going to be merged back into the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Confirms It Did Not Have a Security Breach</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48173</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpml-confirms-it-did-not-have-a-security-breach</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When WPML emailed new &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext&quot;&gt;passwords to customers in plaintext&lt;/a&gt;, some customers thought it was due to a security breach. Amit Kvint, compatibility team leader for WPML, confirmed the emails are not a result of a security breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/2015/09/password-update-email-from-wpml/&quot;&gt;post on the official WPML blog&lt;/a&gt;, Kvint says the emails were a preventive measure to insure accounts remain secure, &amp;#8220;The main purpose and underlying principle for this action was making sure everyone has a good new strong password, we consider this an important step in online security,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvint acknowledges the improvements in WordPress 4.3 in how passwords are handled and admits that sending passwords in plaintext was not a good idea, &amp;#8220;The best practice would be, once the password is sent, to login and reset the password to a new strong one. We will definitely revise the way this is done in the future,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog post does not go into detail in how they determined passwords to be weak. To the best of my knowledge, WPML does not have a policy in place to enforce strong passwords. While no accounts were compromised, if some of the contacted customers choose a weak password, wouldn&amp;#8217;t it defeat the purpose of resetting passwords in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jetpack 3.7 Introduces a Simpler Interface, Adds Support for Development Sites</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48161</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-7-introduces-a-simpler-interface-adds-support-for-development-sites</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/2015/09/09/jetpack-3-7-simpler-ui-support-for-development-sites-and-more/&quot;&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt; and includes a simpler user interface, support for development sites, and fixes several issues with a variety of modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new interface separates some of Jetpack&amp;#8217;s functionality into categories such as, performance and security, traffic growth, and WordPress.com tools. The most commonly used modules are listed first with a link underneath that takes users to the other 27 modules and the old settings page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48162&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png?resize=968%2C492&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack 3.7 Interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack 3.7 Interface
&lt;p&gt;Turning a module on or off is accomplished by clicking a toggle. Services you need to pay for are clearly marked with links to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest drawbacks to Jetpack is switching between a local server or staging environment. If you move your site from one URL to another, Jetpack automatically detects the change and prompts the user to confirm if the URL is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48163&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png?resize=1025%2C155&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack on a staging site&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack on a staging site
&lt;p&gt;If Jetpack thinks two URLs are separate websites, it recommends that you create a new connection to prevent a service interruption on the original domain. The prompt has links to reset the connection, confirm that the URL is part of a development environment, or submit a trouble ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48164&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png?resize=1025%2C143&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites
&lt;p&gt;The VideoPress player in Jetpack 3.7 works on mobile devices thanks to its responsive redesign. Having VideoPress enabled allows you to easily embed VideoPress powered videos to your site by copying and pasting the video&amp;#8217;s URL into the visual editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other changes included in 3.7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to enable per-post opt-out for Subscriptions by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/support/subscriptions/#filters&quot;&gt;adding a filter&lt;/a&gt; to a functionality plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new Widget Visibility rule that allows you to show or hide widgets based on a page’s parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing buttons now display on bbPress forum posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; from the WordPress plugin directory. To view a list of all the changes in this release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/changelog/&quot;&gt;check out the changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Conceptual WordPress Plugin by Stephen Cronin That Makes Comment Moderation Easier</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48149</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-conceptual-wordpress-plugin-by-stephen-cronin-that-makes-comment-moderation-easier</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Moderating replies to comments in the backend of WordPress is tough. For example, WordPress 4.3 displays the reply and who it&amp;#8217;s in response too, but doesn&amp;#8217;t show the text of the parent comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t see the parent comment unless you open the author link in a new browser tab. This is not an optimal user experience and makes it more difficult to determine if the reply is from a spammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48150&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png?resize=851%2C161&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;Show Parent Comment&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Cronin, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/&quot;&gt;Scratch99 Design&lt;/a&gt;, is a potential solution to the problem. Simply activate and browse to the comment section of the WordPress backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show Parent Comment displays the text of the parent comment inside the reply. This helps moderators keep track of the conversation and helps to identify copy/paste spammers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48151&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png?resize=847%2C223&quot; alt=&quot;Show Parent Comment Plugin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easy Way to See The Parent Comment
&lt;p&gt;While the plugin works as advertised and shows the parent comment text, the interface needs to be improved. I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of the background color and some of the comment information is repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea is to replace the &lt;strong&gt;In Reply to Author&lt;/strong&gt; text to say, &lt;strong&gt;In Response To&lt;/strong&gt;. The show more or less button is a good idea but I think the text size needs to be increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Show Parent Comment is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;plugin directory for free&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s a proof of concept and is not officially supported by Cronin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept needs work but I think something similar needs to be added to WordPress core. As it stands, moderating comment replies is not a great experience and I think Cronin&amp;#8217;s plugin is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Emails Passwords to Affected Customers in Plaintext</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48123</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-31477&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png?resize=637%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Clear Text Password&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/thegloaming/1402099967/&quot;&gt;thegloaming&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;Customers who purchased &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/&quot;&gt;WPML&lt;/a&gt;, a multilingual plugin for WordPress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-699832&quot;&gt;are receiving&lt;/a&gt; a suspicious email that looks similar to a phishing attempt. Matt Radford, a customer of WPML, kindly sent the Tavern a copy of the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Matt&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure that your WPML account remains secure. For this, we are updating all client accounts with auto-generated strong passwords. A strong password helps prevent unauthorized use of your WPML account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our system will start the password update shortly. We will send you another email with your new password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WPML team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radford received a follow-up email that includes his new password in plaintext. WPML explains why the passwords were sent in plaintext, &amp;#8220;We detected weak passwords in our system and following this we are enforcing, on a one-time procedure, strong passwords to all our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As for sending them in plaintext, if you consider it not to be safe, please update your password in order to keep it secure,&amp;#8221; WPML said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When questioned if passwords are stored in plaintext within the database, WPML replied, &amp;#8220;As for storing passwords in our database we are not storing it in plaintext, we are using standard WordPress. Yes they&amp;#8217;re salted and hashed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise VanDeCruze, a WPML support forum moderator, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-700143&quot;&gt;the email was generated automatically&lt;/a&gt; from their systems. She confirms that sending passwords in plaintext is not a best practice and urges users to login to their accounts and generate a new password using the reset password link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This email was automatically generated by our system and sent to clients with passwords that were deemed too simple. However, sending new passwords in plain text via email without requiring user action is not best practice. I urge you to change your WPML account password. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were right to be cautious of this sudden email. Although it was not a phishing attempt, it was not the best way to ensure a safe password. In the future we will be mindful of adhering to strict security standards. Please let me know if you have any further questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WPML has not published any information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/blog/&quot;&gt;its blog&lt;/a&gt; that explains the situation and has yet to respond to our requests for comment. If you&amp;#8217;re a WPML customer and receive an email with a new password, you should immediately login and generate a new password using the site&amp;#8217;s reset password link and follow the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emailing passwords in plaintext is a terrible security practice. One of the key improvements in WordPress 4.3 is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/&quot;&gt;WordPress no longer emails passwords&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it sends password reset links that expire after 24 hours. In hindsight, WPML should have generated and sent password reset emails to affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Help Me Add Comment Approval Notifications to WordPress</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48059</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/help-me-add-comment-approval-notifications-to-wordpress</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy&quot;&gt;enabling comment moderation&lt;/a&gt; on the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;ve discovered that WordPress does not notify commenters when their comments are approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;m using the &lt;a title=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot;&gt;Comment Approved&lt;/a&gt; plugin by &lt;a title=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot; href=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot;&gt;Niels van Renselaar&lt;/a&gt;. It allows me to create a custom notification message that is sent when a comment is approved. Unfortunately, I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s working. Please let me know if you&amp;#8217;ve received any comment approval emails from the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe this feature should be in core. I&amp;#8217;ve started the process by creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717&quot;&gt;feature request ticket&lt;/a&gt; on WordPress trac. Let&amp;#8217;s discuss the pros and cons or why you think it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be in core. Please give me your feedback in the comments or within the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: How Chris Klosowski’s Lifestyle Changed by Writing One WordPress Plugin</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48051</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/how-chris-klosowskis-lifestyle-changed-by-writing-one-wordpress-plugin</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Klosowski, co-lead developer of Easy Digital Downloads, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kungfugrep.com/2015/09/how-writing-one-plugin-changed-my-lifestyle/&quot;&gt;explains how writing one plugin&lt;/a&gt; changed his lifestyle. He left his corporate job to be a full-time distributed worker and being a distributed worker comes with its own set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My truest challenge in this new lifestyle is knowing when it’s time to ignore Slack, shut off email, take off the Pebble, and just spend time with my family. It’s a challenge I’m learning to face, and the hardest part is admitting to myself that it’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s come up in conversation a couple times with my wife, and every time, she lets me know when I’m failing. Honesty here is the key. Not guilt, not anger, just brutal honesty of when I’m not being the best husband and dad because I’m putting work before them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges a distributed worker faces is figuring out the balance between work, family, and personal life. If you&amp;#8217;re struggling to find balance, I encourage you to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-mantra-of-family-comes-first&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and the nearly 100 comments that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments are from people in similar positions trying to figure out how to balance work, life, and family. After nearly three years of being a distributed worker, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Bug in Chrome 45 Causes WordPress Admin Menu to Break</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48045</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-bug-in-chrome-45-causes-wordpress-admin-menu-to-break</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Within the last five weeks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33199&quot;&gt;several people have reported&lt;/a&gt; an issue in Chrome that breaks the WordPress admin menu. If you hover the mouse cursor over menu items in the sidebar, they&amp;#8217;ll occasionally fall out-of-place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48046&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png?resize=764%2C543&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome WordPress Admin Menu &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using Chrome 45.0.2454.85, I&amp;#8217;m able to inconsistently reproduce the behaviour reported in the ticket. Through the process of elimination, users discovered Chrome is the software at fault and not WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179#c17&quot;&gt;source of the problem&lt;/a&gt; stems from Slimming Paint which is enabled by default in Chrome 45. Disabling slimming paint fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable this feature, visit &lt;strong&gt;chrome://flags/#disable-slimming-paint&lt;/strong&gt; in Chrome and &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Disable slimming paint&lt;/em&gt; option, and make sure the other two &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; options are disabled because they will override the Disable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds confusing, please refer to the following screenshot provided by Samuel Wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48056&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png?resize=839%2C185&quot; alt=&quot;Disable Slimming Paint Options&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Disable Slimming Paint Options
&lt;p&gt;Chrome&amp;#8217;s development team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179&amp;q=label%3AM-47%20slimming%20paint&amp;colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified&quot;&gt;aware of the issue&lt;/a&gt; and is working towards a solution that is marked for release in Chrome 47. Until then, users are encouraged to disable Slimming Paint until Chrome fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Dashboard Widget That Displays New Registered Users</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48037</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-dashboard-widget-that-displays-new-registered-users</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you run a WordPress site with user registration enabled and want to see recently registered accounts from the dashboard, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/new-user-dashboard/&quot;&gt;New User Dashboard Widget plugin&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/swadeshswain/&quot;&gt;Swadeshswain&lt;/a&gt;. After installing and activating the plugin, a new registered user widget appears on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48038&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png?resize=536%2C146&quot; alt=&quot;New Registered User Widget&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New Registered User Widget
&lt;p&gt;The widget tells you a user&amp;#8217;s registration date, name, and role. If you don&amp;#8217;t see the widget after activating the plugin, click on the Screen Options tab and make sure the box next to New User is checked. New User Dashboard Widget is the type of plugin that does one thing only and does it well. There&amp;#8217;s nothing to configure and it works out-of-the-box with WordPress 4.3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Proposal to Overhaul the Shortcode API in WordPress Goes Back to the Drawing Board</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48026</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/proposal-to-overhaul-the-shortcode-api-in-wordpress-goes-back-to-the-drawing-board</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/miqrogroove&quot;&gt;Robert Chapin&lt;/a&gt;, who contributes to WordPress core, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;published the first draft&lt;/a&gt; of a roadmap that explains how the Shortcode API could be overhauled. &amp;#8220;The decision to create this roadmap arose from specific needs that are not met by the old code,&amp;#8221; Chapin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has an aggressive timeline with development starting in WordPress 4.4 and ending in WordPress 4.7. In WordPress 4.4, a new syntax would be introduced that provides opportunities to make significant changes to the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of shortcodes that use the new syntax.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Self-Closing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode attr1=&amp;#8221;value1&amp;#8243; attr2=&amp;#8217;value2&amp;#8242; &amp;#8220;value3&amp;#8221; &amp;#8216;value4&amp;#8217; value5}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Enclosures&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${encl2}$] HTML [${encl3}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escaped Code&lt;/strong&gt;: [!{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the WordPress 4.5 development cycle, the focus would be to deprecate the old syntax, &amp;#8220;Plugins that register shortcodes without declaring support for new features will raise debugging errors to alert developers that support for the old shortcode syntax is ending,&amp;#8221; Chapin said. Posts using the old syntax would  continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the WordPress 4.6 update process, shortcodes using the old syntax would be converted to use the new syntax. The Shortcode API would continue to provide deprecated support for the old syntax to provide a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important point to note is that the new syntax does not support HTML inside of shortcode attributes. This leaves the potential for many sites to break as shortcodes may not perform the same way prior to WordPress 4.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition process ends with WordPress 4.7 where support for the old syntax is eliminated. Shortcodes and plugins that use the old syntax would stop working. During the WordPress 4.7 update process, a second attempt would be made to upgrade old content to use the new syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Proposal Raises Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has drawn constructive criticism from several members of the WordPress community. Nick Haskins, founder of Aesop Interactive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27426&quot;&gt;voiced his concern&lt;/a&gt; saying the syntax isn&amp;#8217;t easier for authors to use and will affect a large number of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://halfelf.org/&quot;&gt;Mika Epstein&lt;/a&gt;, who voluntarily moderates the WordPress.org support forums and interacts with users on a daily basis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27472&quot;&gt;sums up a list of concerns&lt;/a&gt; that many developers agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the plugins and themes on the planet we will break (because we will, they won’t read or test). We have to degrade them as gracefully as humanly possibly. Continuing to say “Well the developers were notified and should have updated” now that we’re as big as we are is not sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the very (legitimately) angry end users who are broken because they didn’t upgrade plugins and themes (or the themes/plugins didn’t get updated). People were rightly angry last time. It’s the end users, not the developers, who will be hardest hit by this change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating clearly to the users that it’s now &lt;code&gt;{{gallery}}&lt;/code&gt;. That’s going to be very hard. Incredibly hard. Updating their old posts (keeping in mind Justin’s Markdown caveat and those who use them as an aside – I know I know) is easier than making sure everyone knows what to do. At best we can keep tabs on the ones built into WP and perhaps use the logic we have in the visual editor NOW to convert them, but we have to figure out how to make sure everyone knows. This is nothing like the move of Menus to customizer. That was confusing, but the users could see what happened. This is a legit change, your old way is no longer going to work. That is huge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of users who have premium themes and plugins that &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; get update alerts. These people are simply not going to know they need to update and this is not their fault. We should never be breaking them if there’s possibly any alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users will be upgraded by their hosts vis-a-vis one-click installs and managed hosting so they will have up to date WP and out of date plugins/themes. So yes, many users will be on 4.7 and then a theme from 2014. It sucks, it’s the reality, we know it’s the reality, we cannot stick our heads in the sand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugins that are already using {{template}} tags in their code. Yeah, I’ve seen it. Most of them use it for search/replace within their own code, but we’ll want to make sure we check for everyone in the repo who might be doing it on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best argument against using the new shortcode syntax is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27518&quot;&gt;made by Stefano Agiletti.&lt;/a&gt; Agiletti says Italian keyboards don&amp;#8217;t have keys that create curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe English people don’t know that { and } are not present in all keyboards directly as the [ and ] are. On Italian keyboards [ and ] are generated using ALT-GR+è or ALT-GR++ and keyboards show ALT-GR basic sign like €@## and [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get { and } you need to type ALT-GR+SHIFT+è and ALT-GR+SHIFT++. Most people don’t know about this combination (I think only those who write code do) and the parentheses are not written on any key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the Drawing Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a considerable amount of feedback and concerns shared by developers, the proposal is heading back to the drawing board. In a comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27484&quot;&gt;summarizing the feedback&lt;/a&gt;, Andrew Nacin confirms that the new shortcode syntax does not fit the core team&amp;#8217;s vision of being easy and intuitive for non-technical authors to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he cautions that the team needs to do something, &amp;#8220;The proposed syntax significantly clashes with the proposed vision and given all of your feedback, we’re clearly going to have to go back to the drawing board. Please note that &lt;strong&gt;we still need to do something&lt;/strong&gt;, but maybe we can think further outside the box.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly encourage you to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;proposal and the comments&lt;/a&gt; that follow it. It&amp;#8217;s a great read that highlights how difficult it will be to make changes to the Shortcode API that don&amp;#8217;t end up causing a lot of sites to break.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48012</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who regularly comment on the Tavern may have noticed that your comments don&amp;#8217;t show up immediately after submitting them. That&amp;#8217;s because about four weeks ago, for the first time in the Tavern&amp;#8217;s history, comment moderation for all comments was enabled. I enabled moderation to address concerns raised by members of the community and to sleep better at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the request of a few readers and to be more transparent, I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/comment-policy&quot;&gt;comment moderation policy&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of at least a dozen people, I&amp;#8217;ve crafted a policy that is easy to read and more importantly, easy to follow. It explains our expectations, has a few tips on writing better comments, and lists possible reasons a comment may be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;&gt;CC0 licensed&lt;/a&gt; which is the least restrictive license offered by Creative Commons. Feel free to copy and modify it for your own use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strive to create a fun, friendly, and inviting atmosphere. The ground rules for commenting on WP Tavern are simple. Treat people the way you want to be treated. Try to understand someone else’s perspective and if you disagree, respectfully explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text is a difficult medium to decipher context. Emoticons and emoji help, but it doesn’t solve the problem. Take a deep breath and assume the commenter has the best of intentions before responding and approach discussions with open minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome different perspectives and viewpoints but we all need to clearly communicate them without tearing the opposition down in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay on point using concise language. If your comment is more than a few paragraphs long, consider publishing it on your own site instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your comment may be deleted if it matches any of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocates an illegal practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses vulgar, profane, or unnecessarily harsh language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is spam or appears to be written primarily to post a link or advertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is written anonymously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains copyrighted material not licensed for distribution on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impersonates another user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains an affiliate link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal insults, including those using racist or sexist terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines are not meant to be an exhaustive list. The deletion of comments is wholly within the discretion of the moderators at WP Tavern and we will err on the side of maintaining a safe and friendly community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;How Do I Report Comments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe a comment published on WP Tavern violates any of the listed guidelines or that you feel needs special attention, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/contact-me&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;. Please do not publicly report comments using social media such as Facebook or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form submissions are sent to authors with comment moderation capabilities. Include a link to the comment in your email with a short explanation as to why it needs our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to reestablish the comment section as a place where people feel welcome to voice their opinions without the fear of being ripped apart. We encourage criticism, disagreements, and open conversation but it needs to take place in a respectful manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: A Day of REST — a conference devoted to the WordPress REST API</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14173</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/a-day-of-rest-a-conference-devoted-to-the-wordpress-rest-api/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;A Day of REST&lt;/a&gt; will be the first ever event dedicated to the WordPress REST API. It&amp;#8217;ll happen on January 28th 2016, with a follow-on hack day on the 29th, and will be held at Bishopsgate Institute in London, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is aimed at developers who want to learn how to interact with the new WordPress REST API. From WordPress developers to Javascript developers, to application developers, A Day of REST promises to provide in-depth information that covers every aspect of the WordPress REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of event I&amp;#8217;ve been hoping to see in the WordPress community. Sessions will vary from an introduction to the WordPress REST API to in-depth case studies and guides on utilizing it in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an incredible and rare opportunity to learn from the people making the API and those extending it further than anyone else. A niche event to be sure, A Day of REST  is a big bet on the WordPress REST API &amp;#8212; which is not yet slated for core, but is widely expected to make it to core in the next few releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference is being organized to supply a clear demand for more information, resources, and education on the subject. At most WordCamps, REST API sessions seem to be some of the most crowded, with the most engaged and curious audiences. A Day of REST will be like those sessions, but much bigger, as the entire day will be dedicated to the single topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is speaking at A Day of REST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14179&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/speakers-day-of-rest-752x603.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;speakers-day-of-rest&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker roster consists of people who are building the WordPress REST API, and those who are already using it for production applications and websites. The speakers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan McCue &amp;#8211;  WordPress REST API co-lead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Hoyle &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Bachhuber &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen Vignos &amp;#8211; Director of Engineering, WIRED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K. Adam White &amp;#8211; Open Web Engineer, Bocoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Lenox &amp;#8211; Design Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Taylor &amp;#8211; Senior Engineer, New York Times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski &amp;#8211; Meta Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post Status will be an official partner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really pleased that Post Status will be the official content partner for A Day of REST. That means I’ll be attending the event, and I&amp;#8217;ll offer a number of in-depth posts related to the WordPress REST API, the sessions, interviews, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll also manage content for some of the larger event announcements, like this one. I&amp;#8217;ve known the organizers for a long time, and they are big supporters of Post Status. A Day of REST offers a really great opportunity for me to work with them and offer my readers some unique privileges and exclusive content for a subject that&amp;#8217;s of interest to most of my audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So who is organizing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14180&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/humans-752x333.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;humans&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/organizations/human-made/&quot;&gt;Human Made&lt;/a&gt;, who’ve brought on board &lt;a href=&quot;http://siobhanmckeown.com/about/&quot;&gt;Siobhan McKeown&lt;/a&gt; to lead the charge putting the event together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Made uses the API in a good bit of their services and product work, are really interested to see more adoption of the API, and are eager to provide education resources so that can happen. Those of you who pay close attention may know that two of Human Made&amp;#8217;s own are actually part of the team of four that does much of the REST API development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rmccue&quot;&gt;Ryan McCue&lt;/a&gt; is the project co-lead, and is generally steering the ship; the API started as his GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle&quot;&gt;Joe Hoyle&lt;/a&gt; is in day to day conversations for project direction and also commits a lot of code to the API; he is a co-founder of Human Made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hack Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 29th January 2016, there will be a WordPress REST API hack day. This event is being hosted by Mozilla Spaces in London. Space for the hack day is limited but the team would love for anyone interested to come along and help make the WordPress REST API. Bring a laptop and expect to get hacking. This event will be for building the REST API specifically, and not geared toward other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ticket details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/tickets/&quot;&gt;from the website&lt;/a&gt;. They’re £125 (+ VAT &amp;amp; booking fees) &amp;#8212; which ends up being around $235 US &amp;#8212; and the price includes all of the usual conference goodies: presentations, lunch, swag, and an informal afterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confirmed sponsors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is excited to already have some awesome sponsors on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prospress.com/&quot;&gt;ProsPress&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sucuri.net/&quot;&gt;Sucuri&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is also looking for more sponsors to get involved and help make this unique event happen. If you’d like to sponsor, send an email to events@humanmade.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the content, you can get updates either from this blog, or from the A Day of REST website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;feelingrestful.com&lt;/a&gt;. You should also follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/feelingrestful&quot;&gt;@feelingrestful&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for live updates. I&amp;#8217;ll have in-depth content and broader event information and the event site will have more general announcements, news, and event updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is quite accessible from much of the world, so I am hopeful and confident that there will be a diverse audience in attendance. I certainly look forward to visiting; and I was pleasantly surprised that it doesn&amp;#8217;t get as cold there as I thought; January temperatures (lows and highs) stay around the 40s (F, or 5-9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_default&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_unit_c&quot;&gt;°&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; C) &amp;#8212; which is likely warmer than it&amp;#8217;ll be where I live in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is an exciting development in the WordPress conference ecosystem and I&amp;#8217;m confident it&amp;#8217;s going to be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Envato Implements Item Support Policy for ThemeForest and CodeCanyon</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47990</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/envato-implements-item-support-policy-for-themeforest-and-codecanyon</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In August of 2014, Envato &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/news/item-support-sustainability-authors-clarity-buyers/&quot;&gt;announced a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; that would allow sellers on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codecanyon.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;CodeCanyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;ThemeForest&lt;/a&gt; to inform buyers whether or not an item is supported. Earlier today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/releases/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/&quot;&gt;Envato implemented&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;Item Support Policy&lt;/a&gt; for sellers on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When browsing items on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, a blue badge indicates the seller provides support. There&amp;#8217;s also a badge and text that informs potential buyers if an item is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47991&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png?resize=639%2C408&quot; alt=&quot;This Item is Supported&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This Item is Supported
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt;, buyers automatically receive six months of support from the date of purchase. If you need support for an entire year, you can buy an extension for a nominal upgrade fee. Envato takes 30% and gives 70% of the purchase to authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of a &lt;b&gt;6-month support extension&lt;/b&gt; for a &lt;b&gt;Regular License&lt;/b&gt; is calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37.5% of the item price (30% of the list price) when purchased at the same time as the license;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;62.5% of the item price (50% of the list price) when purchased during the support period; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87.5% of the item price (70% of the list price) when purchased after the support period has ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Freeman, product manager for Envato, says the changes provide a standardized definition of support, &amp;#8220;Buyers will know exactly what to expect from all purchases on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers who purchased supported items before the new policy went into effect have six months of free tech support starting on September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disgruntled Authors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.envato.com/t/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/3619&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; with over 165 responses, sellers discussed the pros and cons of the policy while some expressed anger. &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/user/jonathan01&quot;&gt;Jonathan Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr3ativ.com/&quot;&gt;Cr3ativ&lt;/a&gt;, who sells several items on ThemeForest, thinks the policy is not as good as alternatives offered outside of the marketplaces because of its confusing complexity for both authors and buyers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure why Envato chose this solution when we already have a well established support/upgrade system in place within most of the WordPress community where 12 months of support is included in the purchase and customers receive a 50% discount to continue receiving support and updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is a work in progress, &amp;#8220;We will be monitoring the impacts of this change very closely and will be tweaking, improving and enhancing the support tools over coming weeks and months,&amp;#8221; Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a buyer or seller on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, let us know what you think of the support policy in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Twenty Sixteen Now Available on GitHub and the WordPress Theme Directory</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47973</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/twenty-sixteen-now-available-on-github-and-the-wordpress-theme-directory</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen, the default theme scheduled to ship with WordPress 4.4, is available for download on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/&quot;&gt;WordPress theme directory&lt;/a&gt;. According &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/29/twenty-sixteen-is-now-on-github/&quot;&gt;to Tammie Lister&lt;/a&gt;, Twenty Sixteen will be developed as if it were a feature plugin and will merge into WordPress core later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development takes place on GitHub, changes will regularly sync up to the WordPress theme directory. By installing and activating Twenty Sixteen from the theme directory, users can easily update to new versions as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Twenty Sixteen has 23 issues and 27 pull requests on GitHub. Many of the issues such as, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/pull/23&quot;&gt;introducing automated Travis CI build testing into Twenty Sixteen,&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/labels/discussion&quot;&gt;up for discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the top half of the Tavern looks like with Twenty Sixteen activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47974&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=1025%2C563&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the content section looks like. Notice the block of code that displays instead of an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47976&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=881%2C648&quot; alt=&quot;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen Activated
&lt;p&gt;Testers are encouraged to open issues and pull requests on GitHub. If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with how GitHub works, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; explains how to contribute to the Twenty Sixteen project. Keep in mind that Twenty Sixteen is a work in progress and should not be used in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Great jazz cover of one of my favorite Kendrick Lamar songs, Rigamortis, which of course is inspired by the great jazz song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=27&amp;v=TstRwZygLAo&quot;&gt;The Thorn by Willie Jones III&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress.com Unveils the Action Bar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47954</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-unveils-the-action-bar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/new-action-bar/&quot;&gt;unveiled a new user interface&lt;/a&gt; called the Action Bar. It&amp;#8217;s a bar that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen for logged in users and is accessible from any device. The bar performs multiple tasks depending on the page you&amp;#8217;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47955&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png?resize=1025%2C627&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Action Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress Action Bar
&lt;p&gt;When on a WordPress.com powered site that you&amp;#8217;re not following, the bar turns into a Follow button. Clicking the follow button will notify you of new posts published on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47956&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png?resize=192%2C60&quot; alt=&quot;Action Bar Follow Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Action Bar Follow Button
&lt;p&gt;If you click the three dots to the right, you&amp;#8217;ll see a variety of options depending upon the page you&amp;#8217;re viewing. If it&amp;#8217;s the homepage, you&amp;#8217;ll see links to download the theme the site uses, report the content, or manage the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re browsing a specific post on a WordPress.com site, you&amp;#8217;ll see an additional link to copy a shortlink for quick and easy sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47957&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png?resize=265%2C319&quot; alt=&quot;Easily Share Posts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easily Share Posts
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com and are logged in, the Follow button turns into a Customize button. This link provides a quick way to enter the Customizer. There&amp;#8217;s also an Edit link if you&amp;#8217;re browsing a published post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47958&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png?resize=307%2C348&quot; alt=&quot;Edit and Customize Links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Edit and Customize Links
&lt;p&gt;If the action bar is too big and you want to minimize it, click the three dots and select the option to Collapse the bar. It will shrink the bar into squares and get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the action bar is the ability to quickly see and download a theme used on a WordPress.com site. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for WordPress.com specific sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailypost.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The Daily Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What annoys me about the action bar is that it disappears when I scroll down. I caught myself scrolling down to read a post and when I looked for the edit button to fix a typo, the action bar was gone. I think it should stay on the screen at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to see the Edit link in the action bar open a front-end editor. It&amp;#8217;s time WordPress.com step up its game and stop forcing users through a backend interface to edit published content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the experimental action bar but at the same time, I question the reasoning for adding yet another user interface element to mimic actions already supported by other buttons and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, between the admin bar, dashboard, the edit link underneath a post, and the action bar, there are now four different ways to edit a post. How many roads are necessary to reach the same destination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com, let me know what you think of the action bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.3.3 Patches Security Vulnerabilities in BuddyPress Messages Component</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47948</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-3-patches-security-vulnerabilities-in-buddypress-messages-component</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-41978&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=828%2C265&quot; alt=&quot;BuddyPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3&lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2015/08/buddypress-2-3-3/&quot;&gt; is available&lt;/a&gt; and users are encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;update as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. A few security vulnerabilities were discovered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/buddypress-components-and-features/#internal-messaging&quot;&gt;BuddyPress Messages, &lt;/a&gt;a core component that allows users to send and receive private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to the BuddyPress team that could allow members to manipulate a failed private outbound message and inject unexpected output to the browser. The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof Katowicz-Kowalewski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the first vulnerability, the BuddyPress core development team independently discovered and fixed related vulnerabilities with the messages component that could allow for carefully crafted private message content to be rendered incorrectly to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3 also fixes a couple of bugs in the 2.3 codebase and improves support for backend changes made in WordPress 4.3. To protect your sites from these vulnerabilities, you should perform a full backup and &lt;strong&gt;update BuddyPress as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Theme Review Team Begins Phasing Out Favicon Support</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47940</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-begins-phasing-out-favicon-support</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main features in WordPress 4.3 are Site Icons. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icon&lt;/a&gt; is an image that represents a website across multiple platforms and replaces Favicons. With Site Icons in WordPress core, the WordPress Theme Review team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;phasing out the feature&lt;/a&gt; in existing themes hosted in the theme directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;p&gt;Justin Tadlock, a theme review admin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;published a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to provide a backwards compatible experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tadlock, the easiest method is to check if the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; function exists. This tells you if the user is running WordPress 4.3 and has the site icon feature available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check if the user has set up a new icon using the core WordPress feature by using the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; conditional tag which returns either &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some example code from the tutorial you can use to handle the check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ( ! function_exists( 'has_site_icon' ) || ! has_site_icon() ) {

    // Output old, custom favicon feature.
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional information, I encourage you to read&lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/wordpress/development/backwards-compatibility-site-icons/&quot;&gt; Stephen Cronin&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; which goes into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Theme Review Team enforces a guideline where features added to core are phased out of themes within two major releases. By the time WordPress 4.5 is released, theme authors will be able to remove legacy code without disrupting the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A survey or application form will soon be published which will result in a pool from which the attendees will be invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit is a rare opportunity for members of various contributor teams to focus and work together in the same physical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual WordPress Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use, build, or make a living with WordPress, please take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2015&quot;&gt;annual survey&lt;/a&gt;. Results will be shared during Matt Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation at WordCamp US. The more people who fill out the survey, the more representative the data will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation from 2014 to see results from the previous survey.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Stream Is Shutting Down Its Cloud Data Storage October 1st</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47925</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/stream-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-data-storage-october-1st</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/introducing-stream-3/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt; and includes some significant improvements. Stream is a WordPress plugin that tracks changes to a site similar to an audit trail. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service&quot;&gt;version two was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, it morphed from a plugin to a service. Activity logs were stored in the cloud which lessened the amount of resources used on local webservers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version three will no longer store data in the cloud. Instead, it will store activity logs locally. The cloud service provided by Stream 2 is closing on &lt;strong&gt;October 1st&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives users a little more than a month to migrate data from the cloud to their local webserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cloud is Expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Carbis, lead developer of Stream, says the time frame was chosen based on a number of factors, &amp;#8220;We chose a 6 week migration window as a balance between bleeding cash and doing the right thing by our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s also helpful to remember that the vast majority of our users are on a Free plan, which only includes 12 weeks of storage. We are monitoring the accounts of each of our paid users and I&amp;#8217;m personally making sure that every one of them has migrated,&amp;#8221; Carbis told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move away from the cloud is largely based on cost. The majority of Stream&amp;#8217;s customers signed up to the free plan with a significant lack of interest in the Pro Subscription. Server costs were also higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XWP to The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lack of income from Stream 2 and acquisition talks failing, Carbis was contracted to do outside work leaving Frankie Jarrett the only person working on the project. Stream&amp;#8217;s investor decided to pull the plug on the project at the same time Jarrett decided to resign from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I heard that Frankie had resigned I gave him a call. We reminisced on our achievements, and threw around some of our ideas on what could have been. That conversation renewed my inspiration. I jotted down some notes, and that’s when things started to turn around,&amp;#8221; Carbis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members from &lt;a href=&quot;https://xwp.co/&quot;&gt;XWP&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to lend a helping hand and the project is now officially under the XWP umbrella. This allows Stream to remain free and open source. The partnership will also facilitate add-on, connectors, and adapters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New in Stream 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is rewritten from the ground up. Activity logs use half the space in the database compared to Stream 2. It supports multisite through the use of Network Admin and uses a dependency injection model to be more extendable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Stream 3 includes a variety of improvements two notable features have been removed, Notifications and Reports. If you depend on these features, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/stream-3-faq/&quot;&gt;review the following FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbis and XWP are taking Stream into a new direction. Stream&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wp-stream/roadmap/&quot;&gt;proposed roadmap&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub and Carbis encourages users to not only review it, but to contribute to the project&amp;#8217;s future, &amp;#8220;I’d like to see Stream’s users contribute more to its direction. Contribution isn’t limited to ideas either. If you can design, develop, or translate, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wp-stream/stream&quot;&gt;contributing to the Stream project&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if Stream can regain the momentum it lost after transitioning to a cloud based system to store data. Now that Stream stores activity logs locally again, those in the EU should be able to use it without breaking privacy laws. Stream is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; on the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Akismet: Quantifying Reddit Bigotry</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1859</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/08/27/quantifying-reddit-bigotry/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2015-08-30): It looks like the team who created the tool decided to retire it due to some reported accuracy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never pass on the opportunity to mix in a little bit of humor with our passion for web content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our engineers, Dan Walmsley, participated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedyhackday.org/la-2015&quot;&gt;Cultivated Wit&amp;#8217;s Comedy Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles last weekend, and his team&amp;#8217;s resulting project has since surfaced on &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-tool-quantifies-reddit-bigotry&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/26/reddit-bigotry-check/&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeredditcheck.com/&quot;&gt;Free Reddit Check&lt;/a&gt;, created by Dan&amp;#8217;s team and crowned with the day&amp;#8217;s top prize, is a site which attempts to quantify the terribleness of Reddit users based on their public comment content and subreddit participation. While perfectly suited for a hack day which pairs developers and comedians, there is certainly usefulness in determining the respectability of a potential online acquaintance. Or just knowing who to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being obsessed with content analysis, community moderation, and keeping the web&amp;#8217;s underbelly in check, we can&amp;#8217;t help but think it&amp;#8217;s a nifty idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1859&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 205 – Interview With Miriam Schwab</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47915</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-205-interview-with-miriam-schwab</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode of WordPress Weekly, I&amp;#8217;m joined by Miriam Schwab, founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://illuminea.com/&quot;&gt;Illuminea&lt;/a&gt;, a web development company based in Israel. She’s also on the Steering Board of &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitaleveisrael.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Eve Israel&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leading communities for professional women in Israel to help empower women economically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab explains her WordPress origin story, what it&amp;#8217;s like to live in Israel, and how active the WordPress community is in her area. She shares her thoughts on the future of WordPress and warns that if it doesn&amp;#8217;t improve the user experience, it will drive users away to competing platforms. At the end of the interview, she tells us her favorite plugins that she installs on most of her client sites.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: First Look at the Twenty Sixteen Default WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47897</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.4 is the last scheduled major release of the year and with it will come a new default theme to replace Twenty Fifteen. On the Make WordPress Core site, Tammie Lister &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/25/introducing-twenty-sixteen/&quot;&gt;published an image gallery&lt;/a&gt; that shows off the design of Twenty Sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lister, the process of determining the new default theme has taken months, &amp;#8220;Lots of themes were considered, eventually settling on the one you see below. It’s a perfect fit,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47898&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png?resize=433%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen
&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen is designed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi&quot;&gt;Takashi Irie,&lt;/a&gt; who also designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2013/12/13/twenty-fourteen-wordpress-3-8-parker/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fourteen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2015/03/19/twenty-fifteen-the-wordpress-default-theme-for-2015/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; default themes. Irie describes Twenty Sixteen as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modernized approach of an ever-popular layout — a horizontal masthead and an optional right sidebar that works well with both blogs and websites. It has custom color options that allow you to make your own Twenty Sixteen. The theme was designed on a harmonious fluid grid with a mobile first approach. This means it looks great on any device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theme has hints of Twenty Fourteen but is different enough to stand on its own as a unique design. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look as modern as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; out-of-the box but the design could change during the 4.4 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help Twenty Sixteen be the best it can be, please join the weekly meetings held every Monday and Friday at 16:00 UTC in the #core-themes channel on &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt;. The meetings are a half hour-long and start once the theme is initially added to WordPress core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think of Twenty Sixteen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: OSTraining Makes Pods Framework Video Training Series Available for Free</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47885</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/ostraining-makes-pods-framework-video-training-series-available-for-free</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-40653&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg?resize=628%2C290&quot; alt=&quot;pods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/&quot;&gt;OSTraining&lt;/a&gt;, a site that offers video training for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and other technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/blog/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;http://pods.io/&quot;&gt;Pods Framework&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;training series&lt;/a&gt; is now available for free. Steve Burge, founder of OSTraining.com, says offering the video series for free is the result of a partnership with the Pods Framework project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This project came about because the OSTraining and Pods teams bumped into each other on a regular basis. I often ran into Jim True and Josh Pollock from Pods. We met at WordCamps and WordPress meetups in Tampa, Orlando, and Miami, FL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Pods team explained that they were working on improving their documentation. They started a YouTube series, wrote tutorials, and started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/pods-lead-developer-scott-kingsley-clark-launches-friends-of-pods-funding-campaign&quot;&gt;Friends of Pods&lt;/a&gt; initiative to support their efforts. Making the videos free is our way of contributing to the Pods project,&amp;#8221; Burge told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burge recorded the series after using Pods to create the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appalachiantrail.com/&quot;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt; website. The series provides an introduction to Pods, templates, creating a custom taxonomy, and more. Those interested can view the series on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;OSTraining.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk9dCVMQRmSptuJ6YdVzMkr5&amp;v=4rm95kNxRXg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a look at the first video in the series which introduces viewers to the Pods Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was created in 2014, the series contains great insight into the project and provides an educational foundation for learning Pods 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Request: Alex King Rememberances</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=22017</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear WordPress community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apologies for the selfish and personal nature of this post. I hope you will forgive me given the circumstances. As most of you know, I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as &amp;#8220;dad&amp;#8221;, but when she gets older she&amp;#8217;ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent more than a decade in the WordPress community and I&amp;#8217;d like to request that you to share a few thoughts or remembrances about me that we can compile and share with her when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have crossed paths or if I have managed to do something that you found helpful, I&amp;#8217;d love it if you would take a few minutes to write it down and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/contact&quot;&gt;send it to me&lt;/a&gt; or my wife: heatherkingcom@gmail.com. If you&amp;#8217;re willing to have the story shared publicly, please indicate that accordingly. By default, we will keep everything confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the thread: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; an ongoing story on this site. View the thread timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Step Up Your Game: How to Work With Successful WordPress Clients</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47868</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/step-up-your-game-how-to-work-with-successful-wordpress-clients</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47869&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Mario Y. Peshev&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Ryan Hellyer&quot; href=&quot;http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mario Peshev&lt;/a&gt;. Mario is the founder and WordPress Architect at &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/p9TnMSFMi2&quot;&gt;DevriX&lt;/a&gt; building and maintaining large WordPress-driven platforms. With over 10,000 hours of consulting and training, Mario&amp;#8217;s Yin and Yang is his Open Source advocacy and business growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning &amp;#8211; Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47879&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png?resize=682%2C281&quot; alt=&quot;Step up your game featured image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58522126@N00/430932479&quot;&gt;Stairwell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a learnaholic for as long as I can remember and when I read the aforementioned quote, it resonates strongly with me. My prelude to WordPress years ago was one of the steps toward improvement and success and I’ve developed a special love-hate relationship with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utmost admiration about its influence over the world in terms of Open Source and opportunities for various people in different niches, and its plague of being diminished and depreciated by professional developers and successful businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to solve these issues as long as the inner circle works towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are happy building lego type websites with random ThemeForest themes and you see that as your future, this post is not for you. If you love doing the same repeatedly for mom and pop shops, this may not resonate with you. This is applicable to people who want to get better at what they do, be more professional, and make some impact by solving complex problems for larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress For a Better Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, I presented at a conference focused on kids and teenagers to motivate them, prepare them for the adult life, and nurture their creativity. Kids these days hardly think about their future, between their teenage emotional dramas and boring homework assignments. If you think about it, how can they be passionate about becoming someone if they have no real idea what they need to know and do on a daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used WordPress as an example of a platform that children can use, one that provides them with the opportunity to develop a talent or passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using WordPress for homework and general notes (or a diary) could indicate interest in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young bloggers can potentially do creative writing or copywriting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly switching themes and playing with colors might open the room to design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding plugins and trying to implement complex combinations is the first step to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing posts, looking at analytics and comparing different titles or photos is the way to marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other potential areas of course, but as long as kids can associate with an activity, become passionate about it, and start digging into it, they can save years of slacking, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars on college degrees for specialties they couldn’t care less about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why more and more people join the WordPress industry and switch boring jobs in order to make a living off of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Types Of WordPress Services Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of opportunities for WordPress work is incredible but the vast pool of WordPress jobs is so vague and blurry, that hiring and educating talent is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep an eye on dozens of job boards, portals, and freelance networks. Clients look for Virtual Assistants to get their websites built. They look for expert WordPress developers to apply content changes to their site or web designers to develop complex plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis I see references to WordPress administrators, programmers, developers, designers, marketers, digital artists, webmasters, VAs, and plenty of other job titles used improperly. As a matter of fact, I’m now fascinated when I see a WordPress related job post or an offer looking for the right type of candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news is that you can do anything with WordPress. The caveat here is that WordPress itself is not a skill. You don’t ask for an Internet expert nowadays and you don’t go to the same doctor when you have a headache or you’ve injured your leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide industry of innocent clients and amateur service providers have made it nearly impossible to tell a developer from a marketer, or from a general user who has installed WordPress with an auto-installer twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Indecent World of WordPress Experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-39089&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Job Titles Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/5565517971&quot;&gt;I love &amp;#8217;84&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a lot about impostor syndrome in several reputable WordPress blogs, and people keep identifying themselves in the comments. In my opinion, this is a problem so insignificant as compared to the ever-growing pool of people claiming to be WordPress Experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last several years, I’ve interacted with people all around the world working with WordPress. From freelancers to successful business owners at conferences, and from beginner virtual assistants to full-stack consultants in social media, blogs and job networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of service providers that I’ve found is the one of &lt;em&gt;WordPress experts&lt;/em&gt;. You can easily substitute expert with specialist, guru, master, ninja and rockstar. Just open a new tab and do a few quick searches in Google, job networks, social media and view the large number of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list are &lt;em&gt;WordPress developers&lt;/em&gt;. A WordPress developer is often described as people who install plugins. There are various possible scenarios, but this is rarely the definition of an actual developer proficient in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some boards or blogs list specific skills that let you filter by programming language or a separate tool. My latest research with 200 contractors with WordPress developer titles led to 170 people who rate themselves with 4 or 5 out of 5 stars in PHP proficiency, and 30 with 3 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 170 people in the first group, 150 were college students, Internet marketers, VAs, and people who have substituted strings in WordPress themes thanks to support forums or help from the Codex. Not a single line of code was written from scratch, let alone building anything, and 4 out of 5 or higher self-assessed their level of PHP experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom McFarlin &lt;a href=&quot;http://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-developers-programmer-implementer/&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the difference between a developer and implementer and I wrote an overview defining &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-job-titles-dont-mean-much-anymore&quot;&gt;various technical skills in the WordPress context&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the lack of proper training, any official educational resource or meaningful set of skills per role, both finding talent and improving one’s skills is being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge you to interview several successful clients around you who looked for skillful WordPress folks. They either happened to know the right people, were recommended someone, ended up with several freelancers who messed up big time, went AWOL and suddenly took the cash and disappeared, couldn’t deliver, or they did and the site is incredibly slow and/or got hacked soon thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s sending serious businesses away and I won’t touch the topic of under pricing services and products which brings the quality and support way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivates people to use a reliable resource in order to grow? The WordPress Foundation, nor any of the big players provide official training curriculum, and a definition for formal roles. There is no WordPress certification program (I won’t get into that to avoid unnecessary discussions), and there are no clear paths for requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WordPress Community is Filled with Amateurs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, our community is a large group mostly composed of amateurs who started using WordPress one way or another. These people started earning money and reached a point where they don’t know where they stand, what they’re proficient in, if they’re doing fine, whether they’re experts, impostors, or somewhere in the middle, and what would be helpful to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still use FTP and work with PHP 5.2-supported hosts. The most popular theme marketplaces provide products with broken and inconsistent code. The WordPress.org plugin repository accepts plenty of plugins with suspicious consistency and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these issues are recognized publicly in the WordPress community. Some hosts prohibit SSH and allow solely FTP. PHP 5.2 will be supported by Core for a while, which doesn’t motivate hosts to upgrade. Marketplaces earn millions from their top sellers, so they’re not interested in quickly bringing up quality as long as poorly coded themes sell well. There’s also no formal constantly reviewed plugin repository for high quality plugins and no one is actively backing this idea up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the last paragraph as a rant, it’s because it is. It’s meant to be a “wake up call” to clients who don’t know better and service providers who want to become better. While the WordPress Core itself is incredibly stable and flexible, the rest of the infrastructure is mostly poorly coded due to under pricing, lack of skills, and lack of more successful clients interested in backing up WordPress teams and consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of people and plenty of applications of WordPress. Whatever you do, it’s your professional duty to offer the right type of service instead of misleading your clients, and be aware of the other pertinent verticals. Moreover, it’s the only way forward working with reputable organizations and large profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a Successful Client?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-32204&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png?resize=636%2C278&quot; alt=&quot;Success Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeveeaar/2035597695/&quot;&gt;seeveeaar&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige Conference&lt;/a&gt; happened a few weeks ago, and Shane Pearlman from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tri.be/&quot;&gt;Modern Tribe&lt;/a&gt; shared his experience in a presentation entitled, Land the Big Fish: Strategies Acquiring Larger Clients. It’s a motivational talk that outlines different strategies on negotiating and landing larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the session, Pearlman is asked, “What’s in it for me to go through all of that headache to procure bigger brand names?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated at the beginning, working with successful clients is not for everyone. Some people are afraid to leave their comfort zone. Others are too lazy to learn new skills or sometimes doing the same thing repeatedly may be their perfect job. For every other entrepreneur or business player, successful clients are exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each small change is magnified when working with successful clients. Usually, they have a lot of employees, a solid budget for marketing and advertising, a lot of traffic, and various complex requirements that help them attract more leads or automate their processes. T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hey are often respectable and have access to more capital. This allows them to invest more since their return of investment is worth it; while taking a risk due to saving a few bucks could very well ruin their reputation and harm their business. There are several examples of products or companies in the WordPress community that were hacked or where updates caused major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with successful clients is extremely rewarding and exciting, but getting there requires ace skills and solid experience, as well as the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Target Successful Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience with banks, telecoms, automotive, airline brands, large educational institutions and media outlets over the last 12 years as a developer and a technical lead, there are several specific areas where courageous WordPress freelancers and small business owners can focus on if they are aiming for growth and successful clients, but aren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have identified some steps for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/08/8-steps-to-move-from-freelancer-to-successful-company/&quot;&gt;moving from a freelancer to a successful company&lt;/a&gt;. Here is what we should focus on in the WordPress context in order to step up our game, understand our industry better, and start acting professionally if we want to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress is a Vague Term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a WordPress Expert says nothing. You may be a lead developer of WordPress or someone who can memorize the order of all submenus under Settings in the admin dashboard. Both are classified as WordPress experts and that’s what many people don’t realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialize in a given niche and polish your skills. Focus on a specific group of projects &amp;#8211; membership websites, eCommerce stores, multisite installs. Become a know-it-all professional for an extensible plugin such as, BuddyPress, Gravity Forms, or Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the value you are providing and what it corresponds to. Be respectful to the broad community of professionals in your area, learn from them, ask them to be your mentors. Even the best athletes and CEOs have coaches, business mentors, and boards of directors. Find out what it is that you do whether it’s design, development, marketing, or something else and learn the skill inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Installments Don’t Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people offer WordPress services as an add-on to their portfolio of other services without realizing the impact it has on the business. While WordPress is used for plenty of purposes, it’s still a technical platform that comes with its own specific set of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what will happen if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a vulnerable plugin that is exploited and your client’s password is stolen, along with their private details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You forget to protect the media uploader and the client uploads sensitive data. Scanned images of contracts and ID cards end up in the public space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your sitemap plugin indexes protected data since you used a plugin that doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a site and sell it to a client, and due to the terrible choice of plugins, the site crashes miserably and kills the server during a demonstration in front of their big clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a small list of what ifs, but they happen all the time. If you don’t possess the skills or offer the wrong service, this could damage your client’s business. Upping your game and providing solutions instead of websites allows you to take care of the infrastructure, maintenance work, support, development, security, marketing of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, be aware of the consequences and partner up with other agencies and consultants. Complete packages are what successful clients look for and inexperienced people often mess up what others have built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Expert Skills Won’t Cut It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients look for professional skills. They have real problems that can’t be solved with yet another plugin, and they are smart enough to know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the business of configuring themes and installing a few plugins for clients, that won’t do it for successful customers. You need to specialize in code, design, user experience, marketing, or something else that brings real value to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large clients are looking for state of the art designs, performant and secure code, brilliant marketing skills, and growth hacking strategy. Large clients are successful because they are outstanding at what they do, the services they offer, and they appreciate high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context-Specific WordPress Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations take their marketing presence and technical stack seriously. They carefully delegate based on multiple factors. Being in a meeting with a large client typically means discussing a use case together with several people such as, a creative director, VP of marketing, network engineer, and project manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being skillful in your niche and ready to provide value, you have to learn the business processes of your target client. Your idea of a solution may be applicable for small sites, but it may very well be a bad fit based on the company policy or the variety of services used by the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, a creative director may require you to prepare your theme to be ADA Section 508 compliant, which is an accessibility standard required by certain organizations. The VP of marketing may ask for a Hubspot integration with Cvent within your website for proper CRM and meeting request management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network engineer could outline that they need to host the solution on-site, and set up a specific set of web application firewalls and internal web server security rules restricting certain process callbacks. The project manager might share a complicated timeline based on the organization load, holiday schedule, decision maker’s availability, conferences, and various deliverables that need to be presented by different people and other third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are things that we’ve been asked for over the past few months. If you are used to working with a specific host using Apache, prepare for writing documentation and shipping to a restricted server running HHVM. If you use a framework that isn’t accessible, you will need to step back, explore the Section 508 standards, and build something compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic solutions are often not the right fit for large clients. But if you’re determined to learn more and become a better professional, that’s the perfect challenge for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solving More Complex Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to adjust to different environments, working with large clients means solving more complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a mom and pop shop is somewhat broken or down, it’s probably not a big deal if their site receives 100 visits per month. But for a project with tens of millions of views a month and thousands of concurrent users, it is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on larger and heavy platforms often means dealing with a lot of data, complex relationships, and solid traffic. This means that every single line of your code and business decision will inevitably impact the entire system in a way visible to hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to cope with these, you should study your specialty in detail and understand what the impact is of every single change. These skills increase your value and let you face similar challenges and solve problems that the majority of beginners can’t even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn a lot about the entire stack, and get to know hundreds of different rules. At some point you will voluntarily violate those rules, being aware of the fact that some design patterns and best practices don’t solve specific problems. It’s better to denormalize a database or minify a compression algorithm in order to solve a business problem for a large platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just as they say at a music college &amp;#8211; you learn the music theory for three years, and then you throw everything away and start playing jazz. You need to know the entire architecture and strategy first in order to decide how to optimize it in the best possible manner, whether it’s using a best practice or violating one for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaming Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have worked solo or in a small team, you will eventually need to partner up or grow. Either way, large projects are time consuming and require different expertise, and it’s unthinkable for one to know it all. Therefore, you will work with other professionals from more industries, team up and solve more complex problems together, and learn more about their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have thought about mastering a single skill, teaming up with the right people will add a few more skills as an extra perk, which will increase the potential of your main skill as well. Working with financial analysts on a project for a bank helped me to understand the entire model of loans and mortgages, as well as the internal banking policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to learn how loans and interests work in different cases and get acquainted with standardized security regulations at companies in the financial field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-44224&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png?resize=688%2C368&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Security Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/8264582@N06/3383392046&quot;&gt;Two Locks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy and security are important topics that people often misjudge. Working with large clients means more responsibility and higher impact in case of a problem. In the process of building a solution or consulting a reputable organization, you will most likely have to comply with various security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of them may seem unnecessary, there is a reason they exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better it is for you, your clients, and future endeavors. If you’re not using VPNs, SSH keys, two-factor authentication, or voice recognition IDS, this may be a good lesson for you. Why are they needed, what problems do they solve, and how can you apply them to your personal data and existing set of clients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization and Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47877&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg?resize=620%2C400&quot; alt=&quot;BrainyQuote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BrainyQuote
&lt;p&gt;In order to be helpful to large businesses as a consultant, or an agency, you need to be reliable. This may be a result of a number of testimonials, successful track record at previous companies or a good portfolio. It’s always challenging to start with large customers, so improving your skills and working hard in order to become valuable is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being organized and process-oriented is essential to most reputable organizations. The majority of them are more conservative and operate slowly, since a minor mistake could cost them millions or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rely on detailed specifications, scope of work documents, use case diagrams, UX mockups/wireframes, E/R diagrams, and a large list of documents. They include every single detail in their planning &amp;#8211; from holidays for each member of their team, to different dependencies from other service providers and third-party members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients have managed to build a process and scale it in a way that grows their revenue in a predictable way. In order to be able to handle large projects, you need to treat them as a small project that takes longer to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use a project management system and version control properly, define your pricing strategy, make sure to predict all of the delays for both communication and payments. Learn how large organizations operate and do your due diligence upfront in order to avoid surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take anything for granted and don’t assume anything. The more confident you are, the higher the possibility of making a major mistake. There are always new automatic deployment strategies or a DevOps service you haven’t heard of, another massive CSS3 grid, or a growth hacking strategy that you haven’t explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more challenges you face, the more you’ll learn, and be able to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Personal WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=21662</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/22/personal-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve forked the FavePersonal theme to release a few changes that I&amp;#8217;ve made to it for my own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improved Gallery feature, including support for WordPress shortcode galleries. If you&amp;#8217;re uploading photos directly to your gallery post, you can use drag and drop to set the order for them now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Post Formats admin UI is now responsive and works great on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the Social plugin from the theme (requested by WP.org) &amp;#8211; it can still be installed separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make tons of misc. code changes to match new coding standards vs. previous coding standards (and pass the theme check).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/maine-gallery-510x469.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gallery&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-22028&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally hoping to have the modified theme hosted on WordPress.org but after weeks of waiting for review, they responded that features of the theme like &lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24520#comment:4&quot;&gt;choosing colors and post formats&lt;/a&gt; should be done in separate plugins instead. This makes no sense to me as these are core features of the theme, but happily there are great places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that will host the project for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Personal theme is quite assuredly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?url=alexking.org&quot;&gt;mobile-friendly&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it a great fit for the importance Google&amp;#8217;s is placing on mobile-friendly sites lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub or, for you technically minded, grab the reop with git. Just make sure to also grab the submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:alexkingorg/wp-personal.git&lt;br /&gt;
cd wp-personal&lt;br /&gt;
git submodule update --init --recursive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/project/personal&quot;&gt;Personal Theme&lt;/a&gt;. View the project timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.3.1 also fixes twenty-six bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.3.1">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.3/?rev=34199&amp;stop_rev=33647">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.3.1</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.3.1.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.3 make it even easier to format your content and customize your site.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.4">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33573&amp;stop_rev=33396">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.4</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.4.</p>

<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 2 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you’ve found a bug, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. Or, if you’re comfortable writing a bug report, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>.

<p><em>Edges polished up</em><br />
<em>Features meliorated</em><br />
<em>Beta Two: go test!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week saw the halfway point for 2015, yay! This seems like a good time to update you on WordCamp happenings in the first half of this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.3.1 also fixes twenty-six bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.3.1">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.3/?rev=34199&amp;stop_rev=33647">list of changes</a>.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.3 make it even easier to format your content and customize your site.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.4">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33573&amp;stop_rev=33396">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.4</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.4.</p>
<p><em>Already testing WordPress 4.3? The second release candidate is now available (<a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-RC2.zip">zip</a>) and it contains these fixes.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 2 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you’ve found a bug, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. Or, if you’re comfortable writing a bug report, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=4.3&amp;group=component&amp;order=priority">everything we’ve fixed</a>.</p>
<p><em>Edges polished up</em><br />
<em>Features meliorated</em><br />
<em>Beta Two: go test!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

	<title>Akismet: Akismet WordPress Plugin 3.1.4</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1873</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/09/24/akismet-3-1-4-wordpress/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Version 3.1.4 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the Akismet plugin for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; is now available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update clarifies the error messages that Akismet uses so that they&amp;#8217;re easier to understand, and it enables link previews in the admin for all links in a comment &amp;#8212; not just the author&amp;#8217;s website link. A fix is also included for a bug that could have caused comment moderation emails to be sent for some comments that were caught as spam.  For a full list of the changes in this release, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/akismet/trunk&quot;&gt;revision log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions. If you need to download the plugin zip file directly, links to all versions are available in &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the WordPress plugins directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1873&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WP Comment Humility Relocates the Comments Top-level Menu Item to the Posts Menu</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48313</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-comment-humility-relocates-the-comments-top-level-menu-item-to-the-posts-menu</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-billie-named-after-jazz-singer-billie-holiday-is-available-for-download&quot;&gt;features in WordPress 4.3&lt;/a&gt; is that comments on pages are disabled by default. If you only enable comments for posts, you may be interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;WP Comment Humility&lt;/a&gt;, a new plugin created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;John James Jacoby&lt;/a&gt; that moves the top-level Comments menu item to the Posts menu. The following screenshot better illustrates what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48314&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png?resize=429%2C378&quot; alt=&quot;Comment Humility in Action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Comment Humility in Action
&lt;p&gt;If a site enables comments for posts only, this location for the menu item makes sense. What if you&amp;#8217;re using Custom Post Types? According the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/faq/&quot;&gt;plugin&amp;#8217;s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, the user experience might be weird, &amp;#8220;If you have a post type other than &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; that supports comments, it may make more sense to not use this plugin,&amp;#8221; Jacoby said. He suggests giving it a try and if the user experience doesn&amp;#8217;t feel right, to disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/stuttter/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;located on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; where you can also submit Pull Requests. WP Comment Humility works out-of-the-box without any configuration options on WordPress 4.3 and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; in the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Highlights From Matt Mullenweg’s Q&amp;A Session on Product Hunt</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48303</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/highlights-from-matt-mullenwegs-qa-session-on-product-hunt</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;On September 22nd, Matt Mullenweg participated in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;question and answer session&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. Product Hunt is a site &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;that lets users share and discover new products. In the session, Mullenweg answers questions like what advice he&amp;#8217;d give to his 20 and 25-year-old self and how he combats burn out. Here are a few highlights from the session.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nikhil V&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Hello Matt, with the upcoming release of the WP REST API in WordPress core, what do you hope to most see built with its capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m hugely excited about the REST API! Once the infrastructure is in, I think we&amp;#8217;ll see really widespread adoption from plugins that right now are creating their endpoints in very ad-hoc ways. Once we iterate a bit more on the core content endpoints and authentication I think we&amp;#8217;ll see a lot more specialized interfaces built on WP as like a content kernel, an engine powering a wide array of applications and interfaces you&amp;#8217;d never imagine having WordPress behind them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erik Torenberg &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;If you could go back in time and give advice for your, say, 20-year-old self, what would you tell yourself? How about 25?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; To my 20-year-old self I would say to be okay with things building up over time. Something I didn&amp;#8217;t appreciate until recently is that there any many productive decades ahead with which to build the things that I feel need to exist in the world. One of the best things I did then was avoid any press or capitalization on my age (to the extent I could) because youth is an ephemeral asset and just a novelty in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my 25-year-old self I would tell him to slow down and think about health more, I burned the candle at both ends that year. I would also say to not get as caught up in mailing list and IRC arguments and discussions, just focus on building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sydney Liu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In the early days of WordPress, what was the 20% that got you the 80% of the results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; There&amp;#8217;s no simple answer there, if I had to pick one thing it would be &lt;em&gt;luck&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Kristof Bernaert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; How do you see WP about 5 years, or how do you want it to see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In 5 years I think that WP will be infinitely easier to use for both power-users, developers, and newbies. You will be able to have a full experience of core, plugins, themes, docs, and support in several dozen languages that will be as large or larger than English. There will be over a million people making their living on top of the platform. Most people will be creating from touch devices, and their content will mostly not come from keyboards (virtual or physical) as an input device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Tys Bradford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;&amp;#8211; Your accomplishments with WordPress have literally changed the face of the internet and enabled people without programming skills to make beautiful and functional websites. Do you think this could be replicated ever with mobile applications (iOS/Android)? I have seen a few companies try, but none have come close to delivering in the way WordPress is able to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Thank you! The ecosystems and app stores for iOS and Android right now are too locked down, and the discoverability and overhead of apps is too distorted, for an approach like WordPress&amp;#8217; to work for mobile applications. The environment for the foreseeable future there is going to favor more centralized apps, my only hope is that at least a few get really successful (including ours) that aren&amp;#8217;t advertising-driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Question Was Not Answered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my question was not answered. However, I&amp;#8217;m going to ask it in this post with the hope that he&amp;#8217;ll answer it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve spent a lot of time, money, and energy trying to create a great mobile experience in WordPress via dedicated apps. As more of the WordPress backend becomes responsive, how will this affect (if any) the priority level of developing the mobile apps versus putting that time and effort into a 100% responsive WordPress backend?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullenweg answers a lot more questions than what&amp;#8217;s listed above but those are the ones that stand out to me. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;read the entire session&lt;/a&gt; on the Product Hunt site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress REST API Is One Major Step Closer to Being Merged Into Core</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48284</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-rest-api-is-one-major-step-closer-to-being-merged-into-core</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After more than three years of development, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://v2.wp-api.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress REST API&lt;/a&gt; is one major step closer to getting merged into core. Ryan McCue, a lead contributor to the project, published the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;official proposal&lt;/a&gt; to merge the API into WordPress. The proposal explains what the REST API is, why it&amp;#8217;s needed, an integration plan, and what happens after the merge. The plan is to integrate the API in two stages, infrastructure and endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Part Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure is the code responsible for routing requests and handling the meta layer of the API, including JSON serialization/deserialization, linking, embedding, and REST best practices. Merging the infrastructure first allows developers to start building upon it and to migrate from existing custom code. The plan is to merge the infrastructure portion of the API in WordPress 4.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endpoints are considered the more complex of the two as they’re responsible for mapping data from the external JSON format to the internal data structures and vice versa. In other words, endpoints are the bridges of communication between WordPress and external applications. To provide more time for core committers to review the code, endpoints will be merged in WordPress 4.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of the API &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API&quot;&gt;takes place on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; but core WordPress development takes place on Subversion and Trac. When the API is merged into core, it will no longer be developed as a separate project. McCue proposes that the best of GitHub and Trac be integrated so developers comfortable with GitHub can continue to contribute to the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the team’s experience with GitHub as well as Trac, we can bring the best of both worlds by helping integrate the two. This would also improve contributions to WordPress as a whole, and benefit the whole community. This will be especially important as we encourage more contributions from the wider community (client authors, for example). We think we can make good progress here, and we’d love to try to help improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress&quot;&gt;GitHub repository for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;s synced to its Subversion counterpart, it does not accept pull requests. If integrating GitHub and Trac proves to be successful, it could open the door for WordPress to accept pull requests or contributions through GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan to merge the API into core is not finalized and the team needs your &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;comments, questions, and opinions&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage you to read the full proposal and the comments as McCue answers additional questions related to the merge. How happy are you to see this merge proposal?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The Impacts HeroPress Is Having on WordPress Communities in India</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48286</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-impacts-heropress-is-having-on-wordpress-communities-in-india</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Topher DeRosia, who recently attended&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia&quot;&gt; WordCamp Pune&lt;/a&gt;, India, &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/subtle-impacts/&quot;&gt;published a post on the HeroPress blog&lt;/a&gt; that describes the subtle impacts the project is having on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saurabh Shukla, lead organizer for WordCamp Pune, says the site inspired not only their speaker selection but their presentations as well, &amp;#8220;We wanted people to derive at least a level of inspiration from the speakers and decided that stories make more sense than presentations,&amp;#8221; Shukla said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of inspiring presentations at WordCamp Pune include, a workshop where people could experience accessibility issues for themselves, WordPress for activism, and building education products for South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Presentation in a Classroom at WordCamp Pune
&lt;p&gt;According to DeRosia, many Indians feel like their WordPress communities are not getting the respect they deserve. DeRosia believes the amount of excitement expressed by Indians for HeroPress is because their work is noticed and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;That&lt;/em&gt; is why India is excited about HeroPress. They’re getting respect. Not just from me, but from thousands of readers around the world,&amp;#8221; DeRosia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although DeRosia says he&amp;#8217;d be content with the impacts the site has had if HeroPress ended today, I would be sad to see it go  because it&amp;#8217;s a great addition to the WordPress community. Thankfully, DeRosia says people are requesting more essays, exchanges of knowledge, shared wisdom, shared respect, and more of the HeroPress spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an essay published on HeroPress or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;project&amp;#8217;s mission&lt;/a&gt; has inspired you in any way, please let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Interview, and Complementing Slack</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45326</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/09/complementing-slack/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.me/tonyconrad&quot;&gt;Tony Conrad&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strictlyvc.com/&quot;&gt;StrictlyVC&lt;/a&gt; event in San Francisco last week, following a dizzyingly talented line-up of &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/chamath-palihapitaya-on-insane-burn-rates-ipos-and-raising-a-new-real-estate-fund/&quot;&gt;Chamath Palihapitiya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dfj.com/content/steve-jurvetson&quot;&gt;Steve Jurvetson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/18/move-over-slack-automattic-mulls-commercializing-its-own-internal-messaging-product/&quot;&gt;Techcrunch has a good write-up with a number of the relevant quotes from the event&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing I&amp;#8217;d like to respond to, because it wasn&amp;#8217;t a direct quote, is the headline &amp;#8220;Move Over Slack? Automattic Mulls Commercializing Its Own Internal Messaging Product.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem is the headline missed the obvious alliteration of &amp;#8220;Mullenweg Mulls,&amp;#8221; &lt;img src=&quot;http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f600.png&quot; alt=&quot;😀&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;but more importantly&amp;#8230; &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; has become a really key tool for both Automattic &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;and WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt; and anything we do with the evolution of &lt;a href=&quot;http://p2theme.com/&quot;&gt;P2&lt;/a&gt; (some of which we already have running internally) will be complementary to Slack, not competitive with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jeff Yablon and the WordPress Foundation Settle Out of Court</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48267</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jeff-yablon-and-the-wordpress-foundation-settle-out-of-court</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation sued Jeff Yablon&lt;/a&gt; for trademark infringement. The Foundation wanted Yablon to stop using its trademarks, dismiss the opposition proceeding, pay the foundation for any profits related to use of the WordPress trademarks, pay up to $100,000 per infringing domain name, transfer the domains and pay other fees and damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline of Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 22nd, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=7&quot;&gt;Yablon filed a request&lt;/a&gt; for default judgement. On June 29th, the Foundation responded to Yablon by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=8&quot;&gt;asking the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board&lt;/a&gt; to deny Yablon&amp;#8217;s request for default judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 9th, David Mermelstein, Administrative Trademark Judge, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=9&quot;&gt;filed a response&lt;/a&gt; that not only denied Yablon&amp;#8217;s motion for default judgment, but also suspended proceedings until the civil case was complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With proceedings suspended, Yablon could no longer file motions or requests with the TTAB. The only option left was to proceed through court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Settlement Between Yablon and The Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 21st, Yablon and the WordPress Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudup.com/cLmq3DWS6MZ&quot;&gt;settled out of court&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48277&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png?resize=839%2C621&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of Settlement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sample of Settlement
&lt;h3&gt;Yablon&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the settlement, by no later than October 15th, Yablon agrees to cease any and all use of the WordPress name, logos, trademarks, and any other name or mark confusingly similar to the term WordPress or its logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also has to cease any and all use of the WordPress Marks, standing alone or in combination with other words or designs, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use in any company name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta-tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personalized URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyword Advertising on Yablon&amp;#8217;s websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media handles or account names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indoor outdoor store signage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letterhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stationary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon must also comply with the terms of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/&quot;&gt;WordPress trademark and domain name policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No later than five days after the effective date (Oct 15th), Yablon has to transfer all of the domains he owns that incorporate the WordPress Mark to the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Yablon acknowledges that the Foundation owns and has the exclusive rights in and to the WordPress marks in connection with the goods and services identified in each of WordPress&amp;#8217; registrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon can no longer do anything inconsistent with the Foundation&amp;#8217;s ownership of its WordPress Marks and registrations thereof, including but not limited to, contesting the Foundation&amp;#8217;s title to or the validity of the WordPress marks or the trademark registrations thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WordPress Foundation&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Yablon transfers the domains to the Foundation and does not breach the terms of the agreement, the Foundation will redirect the domains to a domain of Yablon&amp;#8217;s choosing for 6 months from the effective date or April 1, 2016, whichever comes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 10 days of the domains being transferred, the Foundation will file a stipulated request to withdrawal its U.S. Opposition Proceeding No. 91221895 without prejudice and Case 3:15-cv02745 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, without prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as Yablon does not breach the agreement, the Foundation agrees not to sue for violating its trademarks prior to the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation will not object to Yablon&amp;#8217;s use of the WordPress Marks as part of any subdomains or subdirectories associated with any second level domain name registered to and controlled exclusively by Yablon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples include but are not limited to, wordpress.answerguy.com or answerguy.com/wordpress in connection with services that involve use of the WordPress platform, support the WordPress brand services, and that do not otherwise violate the rights of the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parties agree to bear their own attorney&amp;#8217;s fees and costs, if any were incurred through the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;spoke to Yablon&lt;/a&gt; on the phone in June shortly after the lawsuit was filed, he sounded like he knew what he was getting into and the complexities involved with U.S. Trademarks. Yablon strongly believed he had enough evidence to pursue the matter and to see it through the court system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing the court case all the way through, he chose to give up which in the court system, is not the same thing as losing, as losing or winning sets a precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Yablon didn&amp;#8217;t lose the case, the WordPress Foundation didn&amp;#8217;t win either. It&amp;#8217;s a reminder that the Foundation will aggressively defend its trademarks in the court system if other means prove unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think Yablon’s mission to defend his use of WordPress in a top-level domain name and potentially open the door for others to do the same, was in the best interest of the WordPress community as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: Gravity Flow makes custom form administrative workflows simple</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14337</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/gravity-flow-makes-custom-form-administrative-workflows-simple/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;Gravity Flow&lt;/a&gt; is one of the coolest new plugins I&amp;#8217;ve seen in quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoices, purchase orders, job applications, and employee vacation requests are just a few potential applications for Gravity Flow, which makes form-centric approval, user input, and notification processes simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With Gravity Flow, you use the power of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; to design your forms, and you use Gravity Flow to design your process using easy to use drag-and-drop tools,&amp;#8221; the video states. The flows created in Gravity Flow can be customized to include all sorts of user-defined paths to request stakeholder feedback, get administrative approval, or fire off a notification that a certain step in the flow has been accomplished. It can even be integrated with other notification systems like Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that common to see a WordPress plugin (especially an add-on plugin) that simultaneously targets a niche and serves it so extensively. Gravity Flow is built to extend the powerful Gravity Forms product, and it really takes it an extra mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of potential for Gravity Flow for intranets and other corporate environments with lots of stakeholders and traditionally clunky, email based workflows for approval of common tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trying Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took Gravity Flow for a spin, because there is a handy demo site capability built in. For a plugin this complex, being able to test drive it is a really great feature. Most workflow tasks can take place either in the admin or on the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating workflows feels a lot like adding regular notifications to Gravity Forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14340&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-workflow-752x579.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workflows have many configuration and sending options. And each step can be sorted and arranged to follow a series of steps, and can even allow for delays (like for a scholarship review period, in my example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s the view for an administrator, but someone who is responsible for providing feedback or approval has a front-end view to directly interact with the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14339&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-review-update-workflow-752x872.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-review-update-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;872&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And administrators can see reports of activity for various workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14338&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-reports-752x552.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-reports&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;552&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty simple overview of the plugin, and I&amp;#8217;d recommend you &lt;a href=&quot;http://demo.gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the demo&lt;/a&gt;, or his full &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.gravityflow.io/category/34-walkthroughs&quot;&gt;walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; examples. but this at least highlights some of the plugin&amp;#8217;s power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Development of Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting things about Gravity Flow is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Henty&lt;/a&gt; made it. Steven actually works at Rocketgenius, the company behind Gravity Forms, and he is a developer of the main Gravity Forms product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to Steven about why this isn&amp;#8217;t a Gravity Forms official add-on, and what it&amp;#8217;s like working on a side project for your own company&amp;#8217;s product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocketgenius has a lot of plans and loads of really exciting stuff in the pipeline so it was a question of priorities &amp;#8211; Rocketgenius can’t possibly do absolutely everything at the same time. For me it’s a project that’s niche enough to be an interesting and profitable side project and yet not too time-consuming so I can continue to focus 100% on my day job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterated how important it is to him that he had his team behind him for this project. And Carl Hancock &amp;#8212; co-founder of Rocketgenius &amp;#8212; is excited about Steven&amp;#8217;s product as well, saying &amp;#8220;The product is awesome. It&amp;#8217;s definitely more complex [and] business oriented, but that&amp;#8217;s a good thing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl also shared that Steve has a background that lends itself to thinking about complex problems to solve, working on, &amp;#8220;more enterprise stuff pre-WordPress, on a wide variety of platforms and programming languages.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve did a great job with Gravity Flow, and I&amp;#8217;m happy to see it out there.  On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/gravity-flow/&quot;&gt;his personal blog&lt;/a&gt;, he highlights use cases for the product, which are real world examples based on how his first 100 beta testers are using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gravity ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Rocketgenius employees have Gravity Forms focused side projects, which I think is really cool. Another favorite of mine is David Smith&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://gravitywiz.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Wiz&lt;/a&gt;, that adds functionality snippets, or &amp;#8220;perks&amp;#8221;, to Gravity Forms. The third-party ecosystem is doing well too; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityplus.pro/&quot;&gt;Gravity Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityview.co/&quot;&gt;Gravity View&lt;/a&gt; are two healthy Gravity Forms focused businesses that come to mind, and I&amp;#8217;m sure there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main plugin continues to dominate the WordPress forms space. Though it is commercial only, it powers hundreds of thousands of websites, and has dozens of official &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/&quot;&gt;add-ons&lt;/a&gt;. Carl has told me many times he doesn&amp;#8217;t even view most other WordPress forms plugins as competition (though newer entrants like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ninjaforms.com/&quot;&gt;Ninja Forms&lt;/a&gt; are doing quite well for themselves), as Gravity Forms aims to take marketshare away from complex hosted solutions like Wufoo, rather than gobble up the much larger but less demanding market that just wants simple contact forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up with Gravity Flow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the website&lt;/a&gt;. And the project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stevehenty/gravityflow&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt; as well, as Steve is billing for support and automatic upgrades, which starts at €87 (around $100) per year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems like the longest days are those in between an Apple announcement and when the products are actually available. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to iOS 9, WatchOS 2, 6s+, Apple TV&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Recap of WordCamp Pune, India, by Topher DeRosia</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48212</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48213&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; href=&quot;http://topher1kenobe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Topher DeRosia&lt;/a&gt;. Topher has contributed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe#content-plugins&quot;&gt;number of plugins&lt;/a&gt;, spoken at many WordCamps, and is the lead of documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://easydigitaldownloads.com/&quot;&gt;Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/a&gt; He also operates &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/&quot;&gt;HeroPress.com&lt;/a&gt; on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last July, the lead organizer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pune.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Pune, India &lt;/a&gt;asked if I would come and speak about HeroPress. This post isn&amp;#8217;t going to be about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;HeroPress&lt;/a&gt; nor about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/category/wordcamp/pune/&quot;&gt;my adventures on the trip&lt;/a&gt;. No, this post is going to be about a WordCamp in a relatively large city in India, how it compares to American WordCamps, and some things that were experimented with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Similarities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, WordCamp Pune is exactly like every other WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve been to. The night before the event, there was a speaker dinner with excellent food and wonderful company. Registration was chaotic because WiFi was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone was happy and excited to be there, and it was very loud because everyone wanted to be part of a conversation. It had all the elements I love about WordCamps; handshakes between new friends, hugs between old friends, and huge transfers of information between everyone, it was fantastic. Aside from WordCamp Miami, it&amp;#8217;s also the largest WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended with 500 tickets sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was well-organized, by which I mean things were well planned for, and handled well when they didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Sessions were held in university class rooms. I think they were a little small for the number of attendees, but it didn&amp;#8217;t detract from the experience. Here&amp;#8217;s an example of a room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s Ramya Pandyan talking about being a better blogger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended where the sessions were in a variety of languages. I would expect this in a place like WordCamp EU, but to have it be a variety of &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; languages was fascinating to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unofficial time zone of India is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/04/28/india-journal-understanding-ist-indian-stretchable-time/&quot;&gt;Indian Stretchable Time&lt;/a&gt;. On the first day of WordCamp, Saurabh worked hard to keep things on schedule. We started 30 minutes late, but on Foundation Day, things got started an hour late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was full of people sitting and waiting patiently, but starting on time was &lt;strong&gt;not expected&lt;/strong&gt;. In the US, I would have expected a lot more cranky people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things were heavily guarded. The main venue was quite open, but to get into Foundation Day, I had to let these guys check me with a magnetic wand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48219&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png?resize=904%2C510&quot; alt=&quot;Indian Policemen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then 20 feet away sign in at a guard house, and then 30 feet beyond that show my ID inside the front door of the venue. This kind of thing also happened at restaurants and every time I went into my hotel. No-one was ever aggressive or suspicious, it&amp;#8217;s just something that happened and everyone took it in stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Word Lounge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48220&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png?resize=298%2C462&quot; alt=&quot;Word Lounge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There was a room set aside to be an all day open session for writers. There&amp;#8217;s a local group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlphabetSambar&quot;&gt;Alphabet Sambar&lt;/a&gt; (Sambar is a soup) that has a regular meetup to help each other with writing. They made sure to welcome attendees and keep a good discussion going all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this idea of unconference rooms based on topic. Some people thrive on the group communication that can come from that format, and I&amp;#8217;d love to see other topical open forums at other WordCamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The After Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of quiet after parties, so I can talk to people. I can also appreciate people wanting a pretty intense party atmosphere. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/crccpune&quot;&gt;Classic Rock Coffee Co.&lt;/a&gt; offered both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had three large areas, the largest being almost 6000 sq. ft., one about 800 sq. ft., and an ampitheater with seating for about 100 where they had live classic rock bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was a closed in area with seating for about 40 people that felt more like a cafe or restaurant. The larger open areas had a full bar and restaurant. Except for the cafe, the whole place had a fabric roof which is less sturdy than canvas. It had an outdoors feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at a table of about 15 people and had no trouble communicating with any of them. I was probably 130 feet from the music and it was well contained. I was able to communicate without noise being an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of people sat at tables, in the cafe, in the ampitheater; wherever they were most comfortable. It was probably my favorite after-party venue of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia#gallery-48212-1-slideshow&quot;&gt;Click to view slideshow.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bits and Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult thing for me was trying to discern people through their accents. Just about everyone had a solid handle on English, but there&amp;#8217;s a mental fatigue that comes from parsing the words through an accent. The longer you do it, the harder it gets, especially with sleep deprivation. I tried not to be rude, and people were patient with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a photo area with some crazy hats and people seemed to have a really good time with it. I can see it working at other WordCamps as well. The ladies from Hummingbird got one of me in a crazy hat, but I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48226&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png?resize=1025%2C578&quot; alt=&quot;Crazy Hat Picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was prepared on-site in realtime and it worked. It was mostly sandwiches, and the food prep people took a request, made the sandwich, and handed it to the person in moments. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have expected it to work that smoothly, but it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit and bottled water were available just about all the time, which was nice since it was pretty hot that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the food and language, this WordCamp didn&amp;#8217;t feel all that foreign to me. I suspect it&amp;#8217;s because WordCamps have a solid template for sessions, scheduling, etc. I enjoyed that, it enabled me to really take part in the event without having to stand to the side wondering what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers seemed to be on the ball and did a great job sharing the responsibilities, which I think is vital with a camp this size. The people were engaged, took full advantage of the options available to them, and &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; is what made it a successful WordCamp in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever get the chance to attend a WordCamp in a culture other than your own, I highly recommend you jump at the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Look Inside the Offices of 16 People Who Work With WordPress on a Daily Basis</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48204</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-look-inside-the-offices-of-16-people-who-work-with-wordpress-on-a-daily-basis</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a remote worker environment, people have the choice to work from home or wherever it&amp;#8217;s convenient. Syed Waseem Abbas published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://torquemag.io/inside-the-workplaces-of-16-wordpress-community-mavens/&quot;&gt;guest post on Torquemag,&lt;/a&gt; that looks at the offices of 16 people who work with WordPress on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the offices are classy while others are small. Many of the people featured in the post use one or more Apple products. If you&amp;#8217;re curious as to what my setup looks like, here you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48205&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg?resize=960%2C720&quot; alt=&quot;My Home Office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My Home Office
&lt;p&gt;Most of the work I do is on a Windows 7 Professional 64bit desktop PC with two 23-inch monitors. When I work remotely, I use a fully loaded 15-inch MacBook Pro with retina display from 2013. As a devoted Windows user, I feel like I&amp;#8217;m part of a dying breed, especially within the WordPress ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For WordPress Weekly, I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000PTF0E2&quot;&gt;Samson CO1U&lt;/a&gt; USB powered condenser microphone connected to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/musical-instruments/dp/B001D7UYBO/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442008126&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Rode+Swivel+mount&quot;&gt;Rode PSA1 swivel mount&lt;/a&gt; with a boom arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predominantly work in a sitting position which is why I&amp;#8217;m in the market for a standing desk where the height can be easily adjusted. I&amp;#8217;m also looking for a new office chair where the arm rests don&amp;#8217;t disintegrate within the first year of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions, let me know in the comments. Also, if you need inspiration to create the perfect office environment, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://officetoday.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Office Today&lt;/a&gt;. Office Today features remote offices and locations from across the world used by Automattic employees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: bbPress 2015 Survey Results Show Users Want Attachments, Better Moderation Tools</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48180</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/bbpress-2015-survey-results-show-users-want-attachments-better-moderation-tools</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The bbPress development team &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2015/09/2015-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;published the results&lt;/a&gt; of its 2015 survey. This year, 213 people participated which is 30 more &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2014/05/2014-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;than last year&lt;/a&gt;. After reviewing, replacing, and removing some questions from the 2014 survey, this year&amp;#8217;s survey has 25 questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of survey question types were used to gather the data including, multiple choices, check boxes, text fields, email box, and open‐ended questions. Empty forms were deleted and those marked as incomplete were reviewed individually. Submissions that had no responses on the second and third pages of the survey were excluded from the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highlights From the Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of respondents use bbPress 2.5 and above with WordPress 4.2 and above. Seventy-one percent of participants using bbPress &amp;lt;=1.x.x are also using the latest version of WordPress. This data indicates bbPress users are vigilant in keeping their sites up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of who uses bbPress, 51% of respondents use it on their own sites while 30% create sites with bbPress forums for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48182&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png?resize=485%2C249&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress 2015 Survey Users&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress 2015 Survey Who Uses bbPress
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, the top three languages used are English 74%, German 7%, and French 6.5%. Three-fourths or 75% of bbPress installations are within WordPress either in the domain root, physical directory, or physical subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining 25% are on multisite installations where more than half have activated bbPress network-wide and the rest in multiple networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48183&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg?resize=900%2C237&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress User Installations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress User Installations
&lt;p&gt;One statistic I&amp;#8217;m proud of is that 29% of the respondents found out about the survey through WP Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48184&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png?resize=854%2C328&quot; alt=&quot;How People Found Out About The Survey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The most wanted features in a bbPress theme are, Responsive (69.5%), Light and Fresh Design (52%), and Compatible with the latest bbPress version (49%). A preference for Responsive, mobile-first themes is in fourth place at 39%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, Attachments (42.5%), Ajaxification of Topics and Replies (41.5%), and Moderation tools in the front end (39%) are the most requested features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48196&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png?resize=463%2C219&quot; alt=&quot;2015 Most Requested Features&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2015 Most Requested Features
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of bbPress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercime, a BuddyPress and bbPress core contributor, confirmed at the end of the survey that the bbPress project is alive and well. According to Mercime, the development team is in the middle of a large migration project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/src/humans.txt&quot;&gt;bbPress core team&lt;/a&gt; has been involved in the process of migrating the WordPress Support Forums (English and all Rosetta sites) from bbPress 1.x.x to bbPress 2.5.8 starting with one European-language forums subsite which has been already ported and being tested on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this migration has been discussed many times and often over the years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;@johnjamesjacoby&lt;/a&gt; formally started the process when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/05/15/wp-org-forums-plugins-audit/&quot;&gt;posted the results of an audit&lt;/a&gt; to show the custom functionality required for a successful migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involves multiple teams including, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;WP Support team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/&quot;&gt;WP Meta Team&lt;/a&gt;. The migration will impact more than 8 million users on WordPress.org. Any improvements made to bbPress to ease the migration process are going to be merged back into the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;When WPML emailed new &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext&quot;&gt;passwords to customers in plaintext&lt;/a&gt;, some customers thought it was due to a security breach. Amit Kvint, compatibility team leader for WPML, confirmed the emails are not a result of a security breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/2015/09/password-update-email-from-wpml/&quot;&gt;post on the official WPML blog&lt;/a&gt;, Kvint says the emails were a preventive measure to insure accounts remain secure, &amp;#8220;The main purpose and underlying principle for this action was making sure everyone has a good new strong password, we consider this an important step in online security,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvint acknowledges the improvements in WordPress 4.3 in how passwords are handled and admits that sending passwords in plaintext was not a good idea, &amp;#8220;The best practice would be, once the password is sent, to login and reset the password to a new strong one. We will definitely revise the way this is done in the future,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog post does not go into detail in how they determined passwords to be weak. To the best of my knowledge, WPML does not have a policy in place to enforce strong passwords. While no accounts were compromised, if some of the contacted customers choose a weak password, wouldn&amp;#8217;t it defeat the purpose of resetting passwords in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jetpack 3.7 Introduces a Simpler Interface, Adds Support for Development Sites</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48161</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-7-introduces-a-simpler-interface-adds-support-for-development-sites</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/2015/09/09/jetpack-3-7-simpler-ui-support-for-development-sites-and-more/&quot;&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt; and includes a simpler user interface, support for development sites, and fixes several issues with a variety of modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new interface separates some of Jetpack&amp;#8217;s functionality into categories such as, performance and security, traffic growth, and WordPress.com tools. The most commonly used modules are listed first with a link underneath that takes users to the other 27 modules and the old settings page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48162&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png?resize=968%2C492&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack 3.7 Interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack 3.7 Interface
&lt;p&gt;Turning a module on or off is accomplished by clicking a toggle. Services you need to pay for are clearly marked with links to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest drawbacks to Jetpack is switching between a local server or staging environment. If you move your site from one URL to another, Jetpack automatically detects the change and prompts the user to confirm if the URL is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48163&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png?resize=1025%2C155&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack on a staging site&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack on a staging site
&lt;p&gt;If Jetpack thinks two URLs are separate websites, it recommends that you create a new connection to prevent a service interruption on the original domain. The prompt has links to reset the connection, confirm that the URL is part of a development environment, or submit a trouble ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48164&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png?resize=1025%2C143&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites
&lt;p&gt;The VideoPress player in Jetpack 3.7 works on mobile devices thanks to its responsive redesign. Having VideoPress enabled allows you to easily embed VideoPress powered videos to your site by copying and pasting the video&amp;#8217;s URL into the visual editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other changes included in 3.7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to enable per-post opt-out for Subscriptions by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/support/subscriptions/#filters&quot;&gt;adding a filter&lt;/a&gt; to a functionality plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new Widget Visibility rule that allows you to show or hide widgets based on a page’s parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing buttons now display on bbPress forum posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; from the WordPress plugin directory. To view a list of all the changes in this release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/changelog/&quot;&gt;check out the changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Conceptual WordPress Plugin by Stephen Cronin That Makes Comment Moderation Easier</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48149</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-conceptual-wordpress-plugin-by-stephen-cronin-that-makes-comment-moderation-easier</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Moderating replies to comments in the backend of WordPress is tough. For example, WordPress 4.3 displays the reply and who it&amp;#8217;s in response too, but doesn&amp;#8217;t show the text of the parent comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t see the parent comment unless you open the author link in a new browser tab. This is not an optimal user experience and makes it more difficult to determine if the reply is from a spammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48150&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png?resize=851%2C161&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;Show Parent Comment&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Cronin, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/&quot;&gt;Scratch99 Design&lt;/a&gt;, is a potential solution to the problem. Simply activate and browse to the comment section of the WordPress backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show Parent Comment displays the text of the parent comment inside the reply. This helps moderators keep track of the conversation and helps to identify copy/paste spammers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48151&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png?resize=847%2C223&quot; alt=&quot;Show Parent Comment Plugin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easy Way to See The Parent Comment
&lt;p&gt;While the plugin works as advertised and shows the parent comment text, the interface needs to be improved. I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of the background color and some of the comment information is repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea is to replace the &lt;strong&gt;In Reply to Author&lt;/strong&gt; text to say, &lt;strong&gt;In Response To&lt;/strong&gt;. The show more or less button is a good idea but I think the text size needs to be increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Show Parent Comment is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;plugin directory for free&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s a proof of concept and is not officially supported by Cronin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept needs work but I think something similar needs to be added to WordPress core. As it stands, moderating comment replies is not a great experience and I think Cronin&amp;#8217;s plugin is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Emails Passwords to Affected Customers in Plaintext</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48123</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-31477&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png?resize=637%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Clear Text Password&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/thegloaming/1402099967/&quot;&gt;thegloaming&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;Customers who purchased &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/&quot;&gt;WPML&lt;/a&gt;, a multilingual plugin for WordPress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-699832&quot;&gt;are receiving&lt;/a&gt; a suspicious email that looks similar to a phishing attempt. Matt Radford, a customer of WPML, kindly sent the Tavern a copy of the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Matt&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure that your WPML account remains secure. For this, we are updating all client accounts with auto-generated strong passwords. A strong password helps prevent unauthorized use of your WPML account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our system will start the password update shortly. We will send you another email with your new password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WPML team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radford received a follow-up email that includes his new password in plaintext. WPML explains why the passwords were sent in plaintext, &amp;#8220;We detected weak passwords in our system and following this we are enforcing, on a one-time procedure, strong passwords to all our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As for sending them in plaintext, if you consider it not to be safe, please update your password in order to keep it secure,&amp;#8221; WPML said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When questioned if passwords are stored in plaintext within the database, WPML replied, &amp;#8220;As for storing passwords in our database we are not storing it in plaintext, we are using standard WordPress. Yes they&amp;#8217;re salted and hashed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise VanDeCruze, a WPML support forum moderator, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-700143&quot;&gt;the email was generated automatically&lt;/a&gt; from their systems. She confirms that sending passwords in plaintext is not a best practice and urges users to login to their accounts and generate a new password using the reset password link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This email was automatically generated by our system and sent to clients with passwords that were deemed too simple. However, sending new passwords in plain text via email without requiring user action is not best practice. I urge you to change your WPML account password. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were right to be cautious of this sudden email. Although it was not a phishing attempt, it was not the best way to ensure a safe password. In the future we will be mindful of adhering to strict security standards. Please let me know if you have any further questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WPML has not published any information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/blog/&quot;&gt;its blog&lt;/a&gt; that explains the situation and has yet to respond to our requests for comment. If you&amp;#8217;re a WPML customer and receive an email with a new password, you should immediately login and generate a new password using the site&amp;#8217;s reset password link and follow the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emailing passwords in plaintext is a terrible security practice. One of the key improvements in WordPress 4.3 is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/&quot;&gt;WordPress no longer emails passwords&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it sends password reset links that expire after 24 hours. In hindsight, WPML should have generated and sent password reset emails to affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Help Me Add Comment Approval Notifications to WordPress</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48059</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/help-me-add-comment-approval-notifications-to-wordpress</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy&quot;&gt;enabling comment moderation&lt;/a&gt; on the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;ve discovered that WordPress does not notify commenters when their comments are approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;m using the &lt;a title=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot;&gt;Comment Approved&lt;/a&gt; plugin by &lt;a title=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot; href=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot;&gt;Niels van Renselaar&lt;/a&gt;. It allows me to create a custom notification message that is sent when a comment is approved. Unfortunately, I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s working. Please let me know if you&amp;#8217;ve received any comment approval emails from the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe this feature should be in core. I&amp;#8217;ve started the process by creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717&quot;&gt;feature request ticket&lt;/a&gt; on WordPress trac. Let&amp;#8217;s discuss the pros and cons or why you think it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be in core. Please give me your feedback in the comments or within the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: How Chris Klosowski’s Lifestyle Changed by Writing One WordPress Plugin</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48051</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/how-chris-klosowskis-lifestyle-changed-by-writing-one-wordpress-plugin</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Klosowski, co-lead developer of Easy Digital Downloads, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kungfugrep.com/2015/09/how-writing-one-plugin-changed-my-lifestyle/&quot;&gt;explains how writing one plugin&lt;/a&gt; changed his lifestyle. He left his corporate job to be a full-time distributed worker and being a distributed worker comes with its own set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My truest challenge in this new lifestyle is knowing when it’s time to ignore Slack, shut off email, take off the Pebble, and just spend time with my family. It’s a challenge I’m learning to face, and the hardest part is admitting to myself that it’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s come up in conversation a couple times with my wife, and every time, she lets me know when I’m failing. Honesty here is the key. Not guilt, not anger, just brutal honesty of when I’m not being the best husband and dad because I’m putting work before them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges a distributed worker faces is figuring out the balance between work, family, and personal life. If you&amp;#8217;re struggling to find balance, I encourage you to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-mantra-of-family-comes-first&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and the nearly 100 comments that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments are from people in similar positions trying to figure out how to balance work, life, and family. After nearly three years of being a distributed worker, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Bug in Chrome 45 Causes WordPress Admin Menu to Break</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48045</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-bug-in-chrome-45-causes-wordpress-admin-menu-to-break</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Within the last five weeks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33199&quot;&gt;several people have reported&lt;/a&gt; an issue in Chrome that breaks the WordPress admin menu. If you hover the mouse cursor over menu items in the sidebar, they&amp;#8217;ll occasionally fall out-of-place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48046&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png?resize=764%2C543&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome WordPress Admin Menu &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using Chrome 45.0.2454.85, I&amp;#8217;m able to inconsistently reproduce the behaviour reported in the ticket. Through the process of elimination, users discovered Chrome is the software at fault and not WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179#c17&quot;&gt;source of the problem&lt;/a&gt; stems from Slimming Paint which is enabled by default in Chrome 45. Disabling slimming paint fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable this feature, visit &lt;strong&gt;chrome://flags/#disable-slimming-paint&lt;/strong&gt; in Chrome and &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Disable slimming paint&lt;/em&gt; option, and make sure the other two &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; options are disabled because they will override the Disable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds confusing, please refer to the following screenshot provided by Samuel Wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48056&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png?resize=839%2C185&quot; alt=&quot;Disable Slimming Paint Options&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Disable Slimming Paint Options
&lt;p&gt;Chrome&amp;#8217;s development team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179&amp;q=label%3AM-47%20slimming%20paint&amp;colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified&quot;&gt;aware of the issue&lt;/a&gt; and is working towards a solution that is marked for release in Chrome 47. Until then, users are encouraged to disable Slimming Paint until Chrome fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Dashboard Widget That Displays New Registered Users</title>

	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-dashboard-widget-that-displays-new-registered-users</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you run a WordPress site with user registration enabled and want to see recently registered accounts from the dashboard, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/new-user-dashboard/&quot;&gt;New User Dashboard Widget plugin&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/swadeshswain/&quot;&gt;Swadeshswain&lt;/a&gt;. After installing and activating the plugin, a new registered user widget appears on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48038&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png?resize=536%2C146&quot; alt=&quot;New Registered User Widget&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New Registered User Widget
&lt;p&gt;The widget tells you a user&amp;#8217;s registration date, name, and role. If you don&amp;#8217;t see the widget after activating the plugin, click on the Screen Options tab and make sure the box next to New User is checked. New User Dashboard Widget is the type of plugin that does one thing only and does it well. There&amp;#8217;s nothing to configure and it works out-of-the-box with WordPress 4.3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Proposal to Overhaul the Shortcode API in WordPress Goes Back to the Drawing Board</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48026</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/proposal-to-overhaul-the-shortcode-api-in-wordpress-goes-back-to-the-drawing-board</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/miqrogroove&quot;&gt;Robert Chapin&lt;/a&gt;, who contributes to WordPress core, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;published the first draft&lt;/a&gt; of a roadmap that explains how the Shortcode API could be overhauled. &amp;#8220;The decision to create this roadmap arose from specific needs that are not met by the old code,&amp;#8221; Chapin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has an aggressive timeline with development starting in WordPress 4.4 and ending in WordPress 4.7. In WordPress 4.4, a new syntax would be introduced that provides opportunities to make significant changes to the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of shortcodes that use the new syntax.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Self-Closing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode attr1=&amp;#8221;value1&amp;#8243; attr2=&amp;#8217;value2&amp;#8242; &amp;#8220;value3&amp;#8221; &amp;#8216;value4&amp;#8217; value5}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Enclosures&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${encl2}$] HTML [${encl3}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escaped Code&lt;/strong&gt;: [!{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the WordPress 4.5 development cycle, the focus would be to deprecate the old syntax, &amp;#8220;Plugins that register shortcodes without declaring support for new features will raise debugging errors to alert developers that support for the old shortcode syntax is ending,&amp;#8221; Chapin said. Posts using the old syntax would  continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the WordPress 4.6 update process, shortcodes using the old syntax would be converted to use the new syntax. The Shortcode API would continue to provide deprecated support for the old syntax to provide a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important point to note is that the new syntax does not support HTML inside of shortcode attributes. This leaves the potential for many sites to break as shortcodes may not perform the same way prior to WordPress 4.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition process ends with WordPress 4.7 where support for the old syntax is eliminated. Shortcodes and plugins that use the old syntax would stop working. During the WordPress 4.7 update process, a second attempt would be made to upgrade old content to use the new syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Proposal Raises Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has drawn constructive criticism from several members of the WordPress community. Nick Haskins, founder of Aesop Interactive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27426&quot;&gt;voiced his concern&lt;/a&gt; saying the syntax isn&amp;#8217;t easier for authors to use and will affect a large number of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://halfelf.org/&quot;&gt;Mika Epstein&lt;/a&gt;, who voluntarily moderates the WordPress.org support forums and interacts with users on a daily basis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27472&quot;&gt;sums up a list of concerns&lt;/a&gt; that many developers agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the plugins and themes on the planet we will break (because we will, they won’t read or test). We have to degrade them as gracefully as humanly possibly. Continuing to say “Well the developers were notified and should have updated” now that we’re as big as we are is not sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the very (legitimately) angry end users who are broken because they didn’t upgrade plugins and themes (or the themes/plugins didn’t get updated). People were rightly angry last time. It’s the end users, not the developers, who will be hardest hit by this change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating clearly to the users that it’s now &lt;code&gt;{{gallery}}&lt;/code&gt;. That’s going to be very hard. Incredibly hard. Updating their old posts (keeping in mind Justin’s Markdown caveat and those who use them as an aside – I know I know) is easier than making sure everyone knows what to do. At best we can keep tabs on the ones built into WP and perhaps use the logic we have in the visual editor NOW to convert them, but we have to figure out how to make sure everyone knows. This is nothing like the move of Menus to customizer. That was confusing, but the users could see what happened. This is a legit change, your old way is no longer going to work. That is huge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of users who have premium themes and plugins that &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; get update alerts. These people are simply not going to know they need to update and this is not their fault. We should never be breaking them if there’s possibly any alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users will be upgraded by their hosts vis-a-vis one-click installs and managed hosting so they will have up to date WP and out of date plugins/themes. So yes, many users will be on 4.7 and then a theme from 2014. It sucks, it’s the reality, we know it’s the reality, we cannot stick our heads in the sand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugins that are already using {{template}} tags in their code. Yeah, I’ve seen it. Most of them use it for search/replace within their own code, but we’ll want to make sure we check for everyone in the repo who might be doing it on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best argument against using the new shortcode syntax is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27518&quot;&gt;made by Stefano Agiletti.&lt;/a&gt; Agiletti says Italian keyboards don&amp;#8217;t have keys that create curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe English people don’t know that { and } are not present in all keyboards directly as the [ and ] are. On Italian keyboards [ and ] are generated using ALT-GR+è or ALT-GR++ and keyboards show ALT-GR basic sign like €@## and [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get { and } you need to type ALT-GR+SHIFT+è and ALT-GR+SHIFT++. Most people don’t know about this combination (I think only those who write code do) and the parentheses are not written on any key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the Drawing Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a considerable amount of feedback and concerns shared by developers, the proposal is heading back to the drawing board. In a comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27484&quot;&gt;summarizing the feedback&lt;/a&gt;, Andrew Nacin confirms that the new shortcode syntax does not fit the core team&amp;#8217;s vision of being easy and intuitive for non-technical authors to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he cautions that the team needs to do something, &amp;#8220;The proposed syntax significantly clashes with the proposed vision and given all of your feedback, we’re clearly going to have to go back to the drawing board. Please note that &lt;strong&gt;we still need to do something&lt;/strong&gt;, but maybe we can think further outside the box.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly encourage you to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;proposal and the comments&lt;/a&gt; that follow it. It&amp;#8217;s a great read that highlights how difficult it will be to make changes to the Shortcode API that don&amp;#8217;t end up causing a lot of sites to break.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48012</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who regularly comment on the Tavern may have noticed that your comments don&amp;#8217;t show up immediately after submitting them. That&amp;#8217;s because about four weeks ago, for the first time in the Tavern&amp;#8217;s history, comment moderation for all comments was enabled. I enabled moderation to address concerns raised by members of the community and to sleep better at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the request of a few readers and to be more transparent, I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/comment-policy&quot;&gt;comment moderation policy&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of at least a dozen people, I&amp;#8217;ve crafted a policy that is easy to read and more importantly, easy to follow. It explains our expectations, has a few tips on writing better comments, and lists possible reasons a comment may be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;&gt;CC0 licensed&lt;/a&gt; which is the least restrictive license offered by Creative Commons. Feel free to copy and modify it for your own use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strive to create a fun, friendly, and inviting atmosphere. The ground rules for commenting on WP Tavern are simple. Treat people the way you want to be treated. Try to understand someone else’s perspective and if you disagree, respectfully explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text is a difficult medium to decipher context. Emoticons and emoji help, but it doesn’t solve the problem. Take a deep breath and assume the commenter has the best of intentions before responding and approach discussions with open minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome different perspectives and viewpoints but we all need to clearly communicate them without tearing the opposition down in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay on point using concise language. If your comment is more than a few paragraphs long, consider publishing it on your own site instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your comment may be deleted if it matches any of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocates an illegal practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses vulgar, profane, or unnecessarily harsh language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is spam or appears to be written primarily to post a link or advertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is written anonymously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains copyrighted material not licensed for distribution on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impersonates another user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains an affiliate link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal insults, including those using racist or sexist terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines are not meant to be an exhaustive list. The deletion of comments is wholly within the discretion of the moderators at WP Tavern and we will err on the side of maintaining a safe and friendly community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;How Do I Report Comments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe a comment published on WP Tavern violates any of the listed guidelines or that you feel needs special attention, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/contact-me&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;. Please do not publicly report comments using social media such as Facebook or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form submissions are sent to authors with comment moderation capabilities. Include a link to the comment in your email with a short explanation as to why it needs our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to reestablish the comment section as a place where people feel welcome to voice their opinions without the fear of being ripped apart. We encourage criticism, disagreements, and open conversation but it needs to take place in a respectful manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: A Day of REST — a conference devoted to the WordPress REST API</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14173</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/a-day-of-rest-a-conference-devoted-to-the-wordpress-rest-api/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;A Day of REST&lt;/a&gt; will be the first ever event dedicated to the WordPress REST API. It&amp;#8217;ll happen on January 28th 2016, with a follow-on hack day on the 29th, and will be held at Bishopsgate Institute in London, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is aimed at developers who want to learn how to interact with the new WordPress REST API. From WordPress developers to Javascript developers, to application developers, A Day of REST promises to provide in-depth information that covers every aspect of the WordPress REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of event I&amp;#8217;ve been hoping to see in the WordPress community. Sessions will vary from an introduction to the WordPress REST API to in-depth case studies and guides on utilizing it in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an incredible and rare opportunity to learn from the people making the API and those extending it further than anyone else. A niche event to be sure, A Day of REST  is a big bet on the WordPress REST API &amp;#8212; which is not yet slated for core, but is widely expected to make it to core in the next few releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference is being organized to supply a clear demand for more information, resources, and education on the subject. At most WordCamps, REST API sessions seem to be some of the most crowded, with the most engaged and curious audiences. A Day of REST will be like those sessions, but much bigger, as the entire day will be dedicated to the single topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is speaking at A Day of REST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14179&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/speakers-day-of-rest-752x603.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;speakers-day-of-rest&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker roster consists of people who are building the WordPress REST API, and those who are already using it for production applications and websites. The speakers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan McCue &amp;#8211;  WordPress REST API co-lead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Hoyle &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Bachhuber &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen Vignos &amp;#8211; Director of Engineering, WIRED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K. Adam White &amp;#8211; Open Web Engineer, Bocoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Lenox &amp;#8211; Design Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Taylor &amp;#8211; Senior Engineer, New York Times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski &amp;#8211; Meta Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post Status will be an official partner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really pleased that Post Status will be the official content partner for A Day of REST. That means I’ll be attending the event, and I&amp;#8217;ll offer a number of in-depth posts related to the WordPress REST API, the sessions, interviews, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll also manage content for some of the larger event announcements, like this one. I&amp;#8217;ve known the organizers for a long time, and they are big supporters of Post Status. A Day of REST offers a really great opportunity for me to work with them and offer my readers some unique privileges and exclusive content for a subject that&amp;#8217;s of interest to most of my audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So who is organizing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14180&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/humans-752x333.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;humans&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/organizations/human-made/&quot;&gt;Human Made&lt;/a&gt;, who’ve brought on board &lt;a href=&quot;http://siobhanmckeown.com/about/&quot;&gt;Siobhan McKeown&lt;/a&gt; to lead the charge putting the event together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Made uses the API in a good bit of their services and product work, are really interested to see more adoption of the API, and are eager to provide education resources so that can happen. Those of you who pay close attention may know that two of Human Made&amp;#8217;s own are actually part of the team of four that does much of the REST API development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rmccue&quot;&gt;Ryan McCue&lt;/a&gt; is the project co-lead, and is generally steering the ship; the API started as his GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle&quot;&gt;Joe Hoyle&lt;/a&gt; is in day to day conversations for project direction and also commits a lot of code to the API; he is a co-founder of Human Made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hack Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 29th January 2016, there will be a WordPress REST API hack day. This event is being hosted by Mozilla Spaces in London. Space for the hack day is limited but the team would love for anyone interested to come along and help make the WordPress REST API. Bring a laptop and expect to get hacking. This event will be for building the REST API specifically, and not geared toward other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ticket details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/tickets/&quot;&gt;from the website&lt;/a&gt;. They’re £125 (+ VAT &amp;amp; booking fees) &amp;#8212; which ends up being around $235 US &amp;#8212; and the price includes all of the usual conference goodies: presentations, lunch, swag, and an informal afterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confirmed sponsors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is excited to already have some awesome sponsors on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prospress.com/&quot;&gt;ProsPress&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sucuri.net/&quot;&gt;Sucuri&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is also looking for more sponsors to get involved and help make this unique event happen. If you’d like to sponsor, send an email to events@humanmade.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the content, you can get updates either from this blog, or from the A Day of REST website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;feelingrestful.com&lt;/a&gt;. You should also follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/feelingrestful&quot;&gt;@feelingrestful&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for live updates. I&amp;#8217;ll have in-depth content and broader event information and the event site will have more general announcements, news, and event updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is quite accessible from much of the world, so I am hopeful and confident that there will be a diverse audience in attendance. I certainly look forward to visiting; and I was pleasantly surprised that it doesn&amp;#8217;t get as cold there as I thought; January temperatures (lows and highs) stay around the 40s (F, or 5-9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_default&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_unit_c&quot;&gt;°&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; C) &amp;#8212; which is likely warmer than it&amp;#8217;ll be where I live in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is an exciting development in the WordPress conference ecosystem and I&amp;#8217;m confident it&amp;#8217;s going to be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Envato Implements Item Support Policy for ThemeForest and CodeCanyon</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47990</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/envato-implements-item-support-policy-for-themeforest-and-codecanyon</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In August of 2014, Envato &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/news/item-support-sustainability-authors-clarity-buyers/&quot;&gt;announced a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; that would allow sellers on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codecanyon.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;CodeCanyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;ThemeForest&lt;/a&gt; to inform buyers whether or not an item is supported. Earlier today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/releases/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/&quot;&gt;Envato implemented&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;Item Support Policy&lt;/a&gt; for sellers on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When browsing items on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, a blue badge indicates the seller provides support. There&amp;#8217;s also a badge and text that informs potential buyers if an item is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47991&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png?resize=639%2C408&quot; alt=&quot;This Item is Supported&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This Item is Supported
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt;, buyers automatically receive six months of support from the date of purchase. If you need support for an entire year, you can buy an extension for a nominal upgrade fee. Envato takes 30% and gives 70% of the purchase to authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of a &lt;b&gt;6-month support extension&lt;/b&gt; for a &lt;b&gt;Regular License&lt;/b&gt; is calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37.5% of the item price (30% of the list price) when purchased at the same time as the license;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;62.5% of the item price (50% of the list price) when purchased during the support period; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87.5% of the item price (70% of the list price) when purchased after the support period has ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Freeman, product manager for Envato, says the changes provide a standardized definition of support, &amp;#8220;Buyers will know exactly what to expect from all purchases on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers who purchased supported items before the new policy went into effect have six months of free tech support starting on September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disgruntled Authors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.envato.com/t/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/3619&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; with over 165 responses, sellers discussed the pros and cons of the policy while some expressed anger. &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/user/jonathan01&quot;&gt;Jonathan Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr3ativ.com/&quot;&gt;Cr3ativ&lt;/a&gt;, who sells several items on ThemeForest, thinks the policy is not as good as alternatives offered outside of the marketplaces because of its confusing complexity for both authors and buyers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure why Envato chose this solution when we already have a well established support/upgrade system in place within most of the WordPress community where 12 months of support is included in the purchase and customers receive a 50% discount to continue receiving support and updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is a work in progress, &amp;#8220;We will be monitoring the impacts of this change very closely and will be tweaking, improving and enhancing the support tools over coming weeks and months,&amp;#8221; Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a buyer or seller on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, let us know what you think of the support policy in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Twenty Sixteen Now Available on GitHub and the WordPress Theme Directory</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47973</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/twenty-sixteen-now-available-on-github-and-the-wordpress-theme-directory</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen, the default theme scheduled to ship with WordPress 4.4, is available for download on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/&quot;&gt;WordPress theme directory&lt;/a&gt;. According &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/29/twenty-sixteen-is-now-on-github/&quot;&gt;to Tammie Lister&lt;/a&gt;, Twenty Sixteen will be developed as if it were a feature plugin and will merge into WordPress core later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development takes place on GitHub, changes will regularly sync up to the WordPress theme directory. By installing and activating Twenty Sixteen from the theme directory, users can easily update to new versions as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Twenty Sixteen has 23 issues and 27 pull requests on GitHub. Many of the issues such as, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/pull/23&quot;&gt;introducing automated Travis CI build testing into Twenty Sixteen,&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/labels/discussion&quot;&gt;up for discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the top half of the Tavern looks like with Twenty Sixteen activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47974&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=1025%2C563&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the content section looks like. Notice the block of code that displays instead of an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47976&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=881%2C648&quot; alt=&quot;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen Activated
&lt;p&gt;Testers are encouraged to open issues and pull requests on GitHub. If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with how GitHub works, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; explains how to contribute to the Twenty Sixteen project. Keep in mind that Twenty Sixteen is a work in progress and should not be used in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress.com Unveils the Action Bar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47954</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-unveils-the-action-bar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/new-action-bar/&quot;&gt;unveiled a new user interface&lt;/a&gt; called the Action Bar. It&amp;#8217;s a bar that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen for logged in users and is accessible from any device. The bar performs multiple tasks depending on the page you&amp;#8217;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47955&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png?resize=1025%2C627&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Action Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress Action Bar
&lt;p&gt;When on a WordPress.com powered site that you&amp;#8217;re not following, the bar turns into a Follow button. Clicking the follow button will notify you of new posts published on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47956&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png?resize=192%2C60&quot; alt=&quot;Action Bar Follow Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Action Bar Follow Button
&lt;p&gt;If you click the three dots to the right, you&amp;#8217;ll see a variety of options depending upon the page you&amp;#8217;re viewing. If it&amp;#8217;s the homepage, you&amp;#8217;ll see links to download the theme the site uses, report the content, or manage the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re browsing a specific post on a WordPress.com site, you&amp;#8217;ll see an additional link to copy a shortlink for quick and easy sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47957&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png?resize=265%2C319&quot; alt=&quot;Easily Share Posts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easily Share Posts
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com and are logged in, the Follow button turns into a Customize button. This link provides a quick way to enter the Customizer. There&amp;#8217;s also an Edit link if you&amp;#8217;re browsing a published post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47958&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png?resize=307%2C348&quot; alt=&quot;Edit and Customize Links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Edit and Customize Links
&lt;p&gt;If the action bar is too big and you want to minimize it, click the three dots and select the option to Collapse the bar. It will shrink the bar into squares and get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the action bar is the ability to quickly see and download a theme used on a WordPress.com site. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for WordPress.com specific sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailypost.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The Daily Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What annoys me about the action bar is that it disappears when I scroll down. I caught myself scrolling down to read a post and when I looked for the edit button to fix a typo, the action bar was gone. I think it should stay on the screen at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to see the Edit link in the action bar open a front-end editor. It&amp;#8217;s time WordPress.com step up its game and stop forcing users through a backend interface to edit published content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the experimental action bar but at the same time, I question the reasoning for adding yet another user interface element to mimic actions already supported by other buttons and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, between the admin bar, dashboard, the edit link underneath a post, and the action bar, there are now four different ways to edit a post. How many roads are necessary to reach the same destination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com, let me know what you think of the action bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.3.3 Patches Security Vulnerabilities in BuddyPress Messages Component</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47948</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-3-patches-security-vulnerabilities-in-buddypress-messages-component</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-41978&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=828%2C265&quot; alt=&quot;BuddyPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3&lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2015/08/buddypress-2-3-3/&quot;&gt; is available&lt;/a&gt; and users are encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;update as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. A few security vulnerabilities were discovered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/buddypress-components-and-features/#internal-messaging&quot;&gt;BuddyPress Messages, &lt;/a&gt;a core component that allows users to send and receive private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to the BuddyPress team that could allow members to manipulate a failed private outbound message and inject unexpected output to the browser. The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof Katowicz-Kowalewski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the first vulnerability, the BuddyPress core development team independently discovered and fixed related vulnerabilities with the messages component that could allow for carefully crafted private message content to be rendered incorrectly to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3 also fixes a couple of bugs in the 2.3 codebase and improves support for backend changes made in WordPress 4.3. To protect your sites from these vulnerabilities, you should perform a full backup and &lt;strong&gt;update BuddyPress as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Theme Review Team Begins Phasing Out Favicon Support</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47940</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-begins-phasing-out-favicon-support</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main features in WordPress 4.3 are Site Icons. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icon&lt;/a&gt; is an image that represents a website across multiple platforms and replaces Favicons. With Site Icons in WordPress core, the WordPress Theme Review team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;phasing out the feature&lt;/a&gt; in existing themes hosted in the theme directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;p&gt;Justin Tadlock, a theme review admin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;published a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to provide a backwards compatible experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tadlock, the easiest method is to check if the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; function exists. This tells you if the user is running WordPress 4.3 and has the site icon feature available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check if the user has set up a new icon using the core WordPress feature by using the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; conditional tag which returns either &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some example code from the tutorial you can use to handle the check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ( ! function_exists( 'has_site_icon' ) || ! has_site_icon() ) {

    // Output old, custom favicon feature.
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional information, I encourage you to read&lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/wordpress/development/backwards-compatibility-site-icons/&quot;&gt; Stephen Cronin&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; which goes into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Theme Review Team enforces a guideline where features added to core are phased out of themes within two major releases. By the time WordPress 4.5 is released, theme authors will be able to remove legacy code without disrupting the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/08/26/2015-wordpress-community-summit-dates-announced/&quot;&gt;WordPress community summit&lt;/a&gt; will take place on December 2-3, 2015, in Philadelphia, PA two days before WordCamp US. The summit&amp;nbsp;will be held at &lt;a href=&quot;http://philadelphia.impacthub.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Impact Hub Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, a co-working space where freelancers, entrepreneurs, and social innovators work together, share ideas, and build networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ImpactHub.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47931&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ImpactHub.jpg?resize=500%2C333&quot; alt=&quot;inside Impact Hub&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Inside Impact HubImpact Hub is spacious and has dedicated meeting and conference rooms. According to the announcement, the summit is invite only similar to last year’s event at WordCamp San Francisco:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WordPress Community Summit is a smaller, invite-only event for&amp;nbsp;active members and contributors on the many teams that work to improve&amp;nbsp;WordPress: Core, Design, Mobile, Accessibility, Support, Polygots, Documentation, Themes, Plugins, Community, Meta, Training, Flow&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;TV .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey or application form will soon be published which will result in a pool from which the attendees will be invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit is a rare opportunity for members of various contributor teams to focus and work together in the same physical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual WordPress Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use, build, or make a living with WordPress, please take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2015&quot;&gt;annual survey&lt;/a&gt;. Results will be shared during Matt Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation at WordCamp US. The more people who fill out the survey, the more representative the data will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation from 2014 to see results from the previous survey.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Stream Is Shutting Down Its Cloud Data Storage October 1st</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47925</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/stream-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-data-storage-october-1st</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/introducing-stream-3/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt; and includes some significant improvements. Stream is a WordPress plugin that tracks changes to a site similar to an audit trail. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service&quot;&gt;version two was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, it morphed from a plugin to a service. Activity logs were stored in the cloud which lessened the amount of resources used on local webservers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version three will no longer store data in the cloud. Instead, it will store activity logs locally. The cloud service provided by Stream 2 is closing on &lt;strong&gt;October 1st&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives users a little more than a month to migrate data from the cloud to their local webserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cloud is Expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Carbis, lead developer of Stream, says the time frame was chosen based on a number of factors, &amp;#8220;We chose a 6 week migration window as a balance between bleeding cash and doing the right thing by our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s also helpful to remember that the vast majority of our users are on a Free plan, which only includes 12 weeks of storage. We are monitoring the accounts of each of our paid users and I&amp;#8217;m personally making sure that every one of them has migrated,&amp;#8221; Carbis told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move away from the cloud is largely based on cost. The majority of Stream&amp;#8217;s customers signed up to the free plan with a significant lack of interest in the Pro Subscription. Server costs were also higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XWP to The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lack of income from Stream 2 and acquisition talks failing, Carbis was contracted to do outside work leaving Frankie Jarrett the only person working on the project. Stream&amp;#8217;s investor decided to pull the plug on the project at the same time Jarrett decided to resign from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I heard that Frankie had resigned I gave him a call. We reminisced on our achievements, and threw around some of our ideas on what could have been. That conversation renewed my inspiration. I jotted down some notes, and that’s when things started to turn around,&amp;#8221; Carbis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members from &lt;a href=&quot;https://xwp.co/&quot;&gt;XWP&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to lend a helping hand and the project is now officially under the XWP umbrella. This allows Stream to remain free and open source. The partnership will also facilitate add-on, connectors, and adapters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New in Stream 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is rewritten from the ground up. Activity logs use half the space in the database compared to Stream 2. It supports multisite through the use of Network Admin and uses a dependency injection model to be more extendable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Stream 3 includes a variety of improvements two notable features have been removed, Notifications and Reports. If you depend on these features, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/stream-3-faq/&quot;&gt;review the following FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbis and XWP are taking Stream into a new direction. Stream&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wp-stream/roadmap/&quot;&gt;proposed roadmap&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub and Carbis encourages users to not only review it, but to contribute to the project&amp;#8217;s future, &amp;#8220;I’d like to see Stream’s users contribute more to its direction. Contribution isn’t limited to ideas either. If you can design, develop, or translate, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wp-stream/stream&quot;&gt;contributing to the Stream project&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if Stream can regain the momentum it lost after transitioning to a cloud based system to store data. Now that Stream stores activity logs locally again, those in the EU should be able to use it without breaking privacy laws. Stream is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; on the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Akismet: Quantifying Reddit Bigotry</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1859</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/08/27/quantifying-reddit-bigotry/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2015-08-30): It looks like the team who created the tool decided to retire it due to some reported accuracy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never pass on the opportunity to mix in a little bit of humor with our passion for web content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our engineers, Dan Walmsley, participated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedyhackday.org/la-2015&quot;&gt;Cultivated Wit&amp;#8217;s Comedy Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles last weekend, and his team&amp;#8217;s resulting project has since surfaced on &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-tool-quantifies-reddit-bigotry&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/26/reddit-bigotry-check/&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeredditcheck.com/&quot;&gt;Free Reddit Check&lt;/a&gt;, created by Dan&amp;#8217;s team and crowned with the day&amp;#8217;s top prize, is a site which attempts to quantify the terribleness of Reddit users based on their public comment content and subreddit participation. While perfectly suited for a hack day which pairs developers and comedians, there is certainly usefulness in determining the respectability of a potential online acquaintance. Or just knowing who to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being obsessed with content analysis, community moderation, and keeping the web&amp;#8217;s underbelly in check, we can&amp;#8217;t help but think it&amp;#8217;s a nifty idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1859&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: First Look at the Twenty Sixteen Default WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47897</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.4 is the last scheduled major release of the year and with it will come a new default theme to replace Twenty Fifteen. On the Make WordPress Core site, Tammie Lister &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/25/introducing-twenty-sixteen/&quot;&gt;published an image gallery&lt;/a&gt; that shows off the design of Twenty Sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lister, the process of determining the new default theme has taken months, &amp;#8220;Lots of themes were considered, eventually settling on the one you see below. It’s a perfect fit,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47898&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png?resize=433%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen
&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen is designed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi&quot;&gt;Takashi Irie,&lt;/a&gt; who also designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2013/12/13/twenty-fourteen-wordpress-3-8-parker/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fourteen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2015/03/19/twenty-fifteen-the-wordpress-default-theme-for-2015/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; default themes. Irie describes Twenty Sixteen as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modernized approach of an ever-popular layout — a horizontal masthead and an optional right sidebar that works well with both blogs and websites. It has custom color options that allow you to make your own Twenty Sixteen. The theme was designed on a harmonious fluid grid with a mobile first approach. This means it looks great on any device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theme has hints of Twenty Fourteen but is different enough to stand on its own as a unique design. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look as modern as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; out-of-the box but the design could change during the 4.4 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help Twenty Sixteen be the best it can be, please join the weekly meetings held every Monday and Friday at 16:00 UTC in the #core-themes channel on &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt;. The meetings are a half hour-long and start once the theme is initially added to WordPress core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think of Twenty Sixteen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: OSTraining Makes Pods Framework Video Training Series Available for Free</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47885</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/ostraining-makes-pods-framework-video-training-series-available-for-free</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-40653&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg?resize=628%2C290&quot; alt=&quot;pods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/&quot;&gt;OSTraining&lt;/a&gt;, a site that offers video training for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and other technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/blog/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;http://pods.io/&quot;&gt;Pods Framework&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;training series&lt;/a&gt; is now available for free. Steve Burge, founder of OSTraining.com, says offering the video series for free is the result of a partnership with the Pods Framework project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This project came about because the OSTraining and Pods teams bumped into each other on a regular basis. I often ran into Jim True and Josh Pollock from Pods. We met at WordCamps and WordPress meetups in Tampa, Orlando, and Miami, FL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Pods team explained that they were working on improving their documentation. They started a YouTube series, wrote tutorials, and started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/pods-lead-developer-scott-kingsley-clark-launches-friends-of-pods-funding-campaign&quot;&gt;Friends of Pods&lt;/a&gt; initiative to support their efforts. Making the videos free is our way of contributing to the Pods project,&amp;#8221; Burge told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burge recorded the series after using Pods to create the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appalachiantrail.com/&quot;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt; website. The series provides an introduction to Pods, templates, creating a custom taxonomy, and more. Those interested can view the series on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;OSTraining.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk9dCVMQRmSptuJ6YdVzMkr5&amp;v=4rm95kNxRXg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a look at the first video in the series which introduces viewers to the Pods Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was created in 2014, the series contains great insight into the project and provides an educational foundation for learning Pods 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Request: Alex King Rememberances</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=22017</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear WordPress community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apologies for the selfish and personal nature of this post. I hope you will forgive me given the circumstances. As most of you know, I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as &amp;#8220;dad&amp;#8221;, but when she gets older she&amp;#8217;ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent more than a decade in the WordPress community and I&amp;#8217;d like to request that you to share a few thoughts or remembrances about me that we can compile and share with her when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have crossed paths or if I have managed to do something that you found helpful, I&amp;#8217;d love it if you would take a few minutes to write it down and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/contact&quot;&gt;send it to me&lt;/a&gt; or my wife: heatherkingcom@gmail.com. If you&amp;#8217;re willing to have the story shared publicly, please indicate that accordingly. By default, we will keep everything confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the thread: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; an ongoing story on this site. View the thread timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning &amp;#8211; Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47879&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png?resize=682%2C281&quot; alt=&quot;Step up your game featured image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58522126@N00/430932479&quot;&gt;Stairwell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a learnaholic for as long as I can remember and when I read the aforementioned quote, it resonates strongly with me. My prelude to WordPress years ago was one of the steps toward improvement and success and I’ve developed a special love-hate relationship with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utmost admiration about its influence over the world in terms of Open Source and opportunities for various people in different niches, and its plague of being diminished and depreciated by professional developers and successful businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to solve these issues as long as the inner circle works towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are happy building lego type websites with random ThemeForest themes and you see that as your future, this post is not for you. If you love doing the same repeatedly for mom and pop shops, this may not resonate with you. This is applicable to people who want to get better at what they do, be more professional, and make some impact by solving complex problems for larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress For a Better Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, I presented at a conference focused on kids and teenagers to motivate them, prepare them for the adult life, and nurture their creativity. Kids these days hardly think about their future, between their teenage emotional dramas and boring homework assignments. If you think about it, how can they be passionate about becoming someone if they have no real idea what they need to know and do on a daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used WordPress as an example of a platform that children can use, one that provides them with the opportunity to develop a talent or passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using WordPress for homework and general notes (or a diary) could indicate interest in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young bloggers can potentially do creative writing or copywriting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly switching themes and playing with colors might open the room to design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding plugins and trying to implement complex combinations is the first step to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing posts, looking at analytics and comparing different titles or photos is the way to marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other potential areas of course, but as long as kids can associate with an activity, become passionate about it, and start digging into it, they can save years of slacking, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars on college degrees for specialties they couldn’t care less about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why more and more people join the WordPress industry and switch boring jobs in order to make a living off of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Types Of WordPress Services Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of opportunities for WordPress work is incredible but the vast pool of WordPress jobs is so vague and blurry, that hiring and educating talent is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep an eye on dozens of job boards, portals, and freelance networks. Clients look for Virtual Assistants to get their websites built. They look for expert WordPress developers to apply content changes to their site or web designers to develop complex plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis I see references to WordPress administrators, programmers, developers, designers, marketers, digital artists, webmasters, VAs, and plenty of other job titles used improperly. As a matter of fact, I’m now fascinated when I see a WordPress related job post or an offer looking for the right type of candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news is that you can do anything with WordPress. The caveat here is that WordPress itself is not a skill. You don’t ask for an Internet expert nowadays and you don’t go to the same doctor when you have a headache or you’ve injured your leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide industry of innocent clients and amateur service providers have made it nearly impossible to tell a developer from a marketer, or from a general user who has installed WordPress with an auto-installer twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Indecent World of WordPress Experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-39089&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Job Titles Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/5565517971&quot;&gt;I love &amp;#8217;84&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a lot about impostor syndrome in several reputable WordPress blogs, and people keep identifying themselves in the comments. In my opinion, this is a problem so insignificant as compared to the ever-growing pool of people claiming to be WordPress Experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last several years, I’ve interacted with people all around the world working with WordPress. From freelancers to successful business owners at conferences, and from beginner virtual assistants to full-stack consultants in social media, blogs and job networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of service providers that I’ve found is the one of &lt;em&gt;WordPress experts&lt;/em&gt;. You can easily substitute expert with specialist, guru, master, ninja and rockstar. Just open a new tab and do a few quick searches in Google, job networks, social media and view the large number of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list are &lt;em&gt;WordPress developers&lt;/em&gt;. A WordPress developer is often described as people who install plugins. There are various possible scenarios, but this is rarely the definition of an actual developer proficient in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some boards or blogs list specific skills that let you filter by programming language or a separate tool. My latest research with 200 contractors with WordPress developer titles led to 170 people who rate themselves with 4 or 5 out of 5 stars in PHP proficiency, and 30 with 3 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 170 people in the first group, 150 were college students, Internet marketers, VAs, and people who have substituted strings in WordPress themes thanks to support forums or help from the Codex. Not a single line of code was written from scratch, let alone building anything, and 4 out of 5 or higher self-assessed their level of PHP experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom McFarlin &lt;a href=&quot;http://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-developers-programmer-implementer/&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the difference between a developer and implementer and I wrote an overview defining &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-job-titles-dont-mean-much-anymore&quot;&gt;various technical skills in the WordPress context&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the lack of proper training, any official educational resource or meaningful set of skills per role, both finding talent and improving one’s skills is being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge you to interview several successful clients around you who looked for skillful WordPress folks. They either happened to know the right people, were recommended someone, ended up with several freelancers who messed up big time, went AWOL and suddenly took the cash and disappeared, couldn’t deliver, or they did and the site is incredibly slow and/or got hacked soon thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s sending serious businesses away and I won’t touch the topic of under pricing services and products which brings the quality and support way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivates people to use a reliable resource in order to grow? The WordPress Foundation, nor any of the big players provide official training curriculum, and a definition for formal roles. There is no WordPress certification program (I won’t get into that to avoid unnecessary discussions), and there are no clear paths for requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WordPress Community is Filled with Amateurs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, our community is a large group mostly composed of amateurs who started using WordPress one way or another. These people started earning money and reached a point where they don’t know where they stand, what they’re proficient in, if they’re doing fine, whether they’re experts, impostors, or somewhere in the middle, and what would be helpful to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still use FTP and work with PHP 5.2-supported hosts. The most popular theme marketplaces provide products with broken and inconsistent code. The WordPress.org plugin repository accepts plenty of plugins with suspicious consistency and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these issues are recognized publicly in the WordPress community. Some hosts prohibit SSH and allow solely FTP. PHP 5.2 will be supported by Core for a while, which doesn’t motivate hosts to upgrade. Marketplaces earn millions from their top sellers, so they’re not interested in quickly bringing up quality as long as poorly coded themes sell well. There’s also no formal constantly reviewed plugin repository for high quality plugins and no one is actively backing this idea up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the last paragraph as a rant, it’s because it is. It’s meant to be a “wake up call” to clients who don’t know better and service providers who want to become better. While the WordPress Core itself is incredibly stable and flexible, the rest of the infrastructure is mostly poorly coded due to under pricing, lack of skills, and lack of more successful clients interested in backing up WordPress teams and consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of people and plenty of applications of WordPress. Whatever you do, it’s your professional duty to offer the right type of service instead of misleading your clients, and be aware of the other pertinent verticals. Moreover, it’s the only way forward working with reputable organizations and large profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a Successful Client?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-32204&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png?resize=636%2C278&quot; alt=&quot;Success Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeveeaar/2035597695/&quot;&gt;seeveeaar&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige Conference&lt;/a&gt; happened a few weeks ago, and Shane Pearlman from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tri.be/&quot;&gt;Modern Tribe&lt;/a&gt; shared his experience in a presentation entitled, Land the Big Fish: Strategies Acquiring Larger Clients. It’s a motivational talk that outlines different strategies on negotiating and landing larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the session, Pearlman is asked, “What’s in it for me to go through all of that headache to procure bigger brand names?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated at the beginning, working with successful clients is not for everyone. Some people are afraid to leave their comfort zone. Others are too lazy to learn new skills or sometimes doing the same thing repeatedly may be their perfect job. For every other entrepreneur or business player, successful clients are exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each small change is magnified when working with successful clients. Usually, they have a lot of employees, a solid budget for marketing and advertising, a lot of traffic, and various complex requirements that help them attract more leads or automate their processes. T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hey are often respectable and have access to more capital. This allows them to invest more since their return of investment is worth it; while taking a risk due to saving a few bucks could very well ruin their reputation and harm their business. There are several examples of products or companies in the WordPress community that were hacked or where updates caused major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with successful clients is extremely rewarding and exciting, but getting there requires ace skills and solid experience, as well as the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Target Successful Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience with banks, telecoms, automotive, airline brands, large educational institutions and media outlets over the last 12 years as a developer and a technical lead, there are several specific areas where courageous WordPress freelancers and small business owners can focus on if they are aiming for growth and successful clients, but aren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have identified some steps for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/08/8-steps-to-move-from-freelancer-to-successful-company/&quot;&gt;moving from a freelancer to a successful company&lt;/a&gt;. Here is what we should focus on in the WordPress context in order to step up our game, understand our industry better, and start acting professionally if we want to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress is a Vague Term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a WordPress Expert says nothing. You may be a lead developer of WordPress or someone who can memorize the order of all submenus under Settings in the admin dashboard. Both are classified as WordPress experts and that’s what many people don’t realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialize in a given niche and polish your skills. Focus on a specific group of projects &amp;#8211; membership websites, eCommerce stores, multisite installs. Become a know-it-all professional for an extensible plugin such as, BuddyPress, Gravity Forms, or Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the value you are providing and what it corresponds to. Be respectful to the broad community of professionals in your area, learn from them, ask them to be your mentors. Even the best athletes and CEOs have coaches, business mentors, and boards of directors. Find out what it is that you do whether it’s design, development, marketing, or something else and learn the skill inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Installments Don’t Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people offer WordPress services as an add-on to their portfolio of other services without realizing the impact it has on the business. While WordPress is used for plenty of purposes, it’s still a technical platform that comes with its own specific set of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what will happen if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a vulnerable plugin that is exploited and your client’s password is stolen, along with their private details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You forget to protect the media uploader and the client uploads sensitive data. Scanned images of contracts and ID cards end up in the public space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your sitemap plugin indexes protected data since you used a plugin that doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a site and sell it to a client, and due to the terrible choice of plugins, the site crashes miserably and kills the server during a demonstration in front of their big clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a small list of what ifs, but they happen all the time. If you don’t possess the skills or offer the wrong service, this could damage your client’s business. Upping your game and providing solutions instead of websites allows you to take care of the infrastructure, maintenance work, support, development, security, marketing of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, be aware of the consequences and partner up with other agencies and consultants. Complete packages are what successful clients look for and inexperienced people often mess up what others have built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Expert Skills Won’t Cut It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients look for professional skills. They have real problems that can’t be solved with yet another plugin, and they are smart enough to know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the business of configuring themes and installing a few plugins for clients, that won’t do it for successful customers. You need to specialize in code, design, user experience, marketing, or something else that brings real value to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large clients are looking for state of the art designs, performant and secure code, brilliant marketing skills, and growth hacking strategy. Large clients are successful because they are outstanding at what they do, the services they offer, and they appreciate high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context-Specific WordPress Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations take their marketing presence and technical stack seriously. They carefully delegate based on multiple factors. Being in a meeting with a large client typically means discussing a use case together with several people such as, a creative director, VP of marketing, network engineer, and project manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being skillful in your niche and ready to provide value, you have to learn the business processes of your target client. Your idea of a solution may be applicable for small sites, but it may very well be a bad fit based on the company policy or the variety of services used by the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, a creative director may require you to prepare your theme to be ADA Section 508 compliant, which is an accessibility standard required by certain organizations. The VP of marketing may ask for a Hubspot integration with Cvent within your website for proper CRM and meeting request management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network engineer could outline that they need to host the solution on-site, and set up a specific set of web application firewalls and internal web server security rules restricting certain process callbacks. The project manager might share a complicated timeline based on the organization load, holiday schedule, decision maker’s availability, conferences, and various deliverables that need to be presented by different people and other third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are things that we’ve been asked for over the past few months. If you are used to working with a specific host using Apache, prepare for writing documentation and shipping to a restricted server running HHVM. If you use a framework that isn’t accessible, you will need to step back, explore the Section 508 standards, and build something compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic solutions are often not the right fit for large clients. But if you’re determined to learn more and become a better professional, that’s the perfect challenge for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solving More Complex Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to adjust to different environments, working with large clients means solving more complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a mom and pop shop is somewhat broken or down, it’s probably not a big deal if their site receives 100 visits per month. But for a project with tens of millions of views a month and thousands of concurrent users, it is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on larger and heavy platforms often means dealing with a lot of data, complex relationships, and solid traffic. This means that every single line of your code and business decision will inevitably impact the entire system in a way visible to hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to cope with these, you should study your specialty in detail and understand what the impact is of every single change. These skills increase your value and let you face similar challenges and solve problems that the majority of beginners can’t even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn a lot about the entire stack, and get to know hundreds of different rules. At some point you will voluntarily violate those rules, being aware of the fact that some design patterns and best practices don’t solve specific problems. It’s better to denormalize a database or minify a compression algorithm in order to solve a business problem for a large platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just as they say at a music college &amp;#8211; you learn the music theory for three years, and then you throw everything away and start playing jazz. You need to know the entire architecture and strategy first in order to decide how to optimize it in the best possible manner, whether it’s using a best practice or violating one for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaming Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have worked solo or in a small team, you will eventually need to partner up or grow. Either way, large projects are time consuming and require different expertise, and it’s unthinkable for one to know it all. Therefore, you will work with other professionals from more industries, team up and solve more complex problems together, and learn more about their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have thought about mastering a single skill, teaming up with the right people will add a few more skills as an extra perk, which will increase the potential of your main skill as well. Working with financial analysts on a project for a bank helped me to understand the entire model of loans and mortgages, as well as the internal banking policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to learn how loans and interests work in different cases and get acquainted with standardized security regulations at companies in the financial field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-44224&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png?resize=688%2C368&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Security Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/8264582@N06/3383392046&quot;&gt;Two Locks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy and security are important topics that people often misjudge. Working with large clients means more responsibility and higher impact in case of a problem. In the process of building a solution or consulting a reputable organization, you will most likely have to comply with various security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of them may seem unnecessary, there is a reason they exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better it is for you, your clients, and future endeavors. If you’re not using VPNs, SSH keys, two-factor authentication, or voice recognition IDS, this may be a good lesson for you. Why are they needed, what problems do they solve, and how can you apply them to your personal data and existing set of clients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization and Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47877&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg?resize=620%2C400&quot; alt=&quot;BrainyQuote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BrainyQuote
&lt;p&gt;In order to be helpful to large businesses as a consultant, or an agency, you need to be reliable. This may be a result of a number of testimonials, successful track record at previous companies or a good portfolio. It’s always challenging to start with large customers, so improving your skills and working hard in order to become valuable is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being organized and process-oriented is essential to most reputable organizations. The majority of them are more conservative and operate slowly, since a minor mistake could cost them millions or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rely on detailed specifications, scope of work documents, use case diagrams, UX mockups/wireframes, E/R diagrams, and a large list of documents. They include every single detail in their planning &amp;#8211; from holidays for each member of their team, to different dependencies from other service providers and third-party members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients have managed to build a process and scale it in a way that grows their revenue in a predictable way. In order to be able to handle large projects, you need to treat them as a small project that takes longer to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use a project management system and version control properly, define your pricing strategy, make sure to predict all of the delays for both communication and payments. Learn how large organizations operate and do your due diligence upfront in order to avoid surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take anything for granted and don’t assume anything. The more confident you are, the higher the possibility of making a major mistake. There are always new automatic deployment strategies or a DevOps service you haven’t heard of, another massive CSS3 grid, or a growth hacking strategy that you haven’t explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more challenges you face, the more you’ll learn, and be able to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Personal WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=21662</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/22/personal-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve forked the FavePersonal theme to release a few changes that I&amp;#8217;ve made to it for my own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improved Gallery feature, including support for WordPress shortcode galleries. If you&amp;#8217;re uploading photos directly to your gallery post, you can use drag and drop to set the order for them now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Post Formats admin UI is now responsive and works great on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the Social plugin from the theme (requested by WP.org) &amp;#8211; it can still be installed separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make tons of misc. code changes to match new coding standards vs. previous coding standards (and pass the theme check).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/maine-gallery-510x469.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gallery&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-22028&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally hoping to have the modified theme hosted on WordPress.org but after weeks of waiting for review, they responded that features of the theme like &lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24520#comment:4&quot;&gt;choosing colors and post formats&lt;/a&gt; should be done in separate plugins instead. This makes no sense to me as these are core features of the theme, but happily there are great places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that will host the project for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Personal theme is quite assuredly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?url=alexking.org&quot;&gt;mobile-friendly&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it a great fit for the importance Google&amp;#8217;s is placing on mobile-friendly sites lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub or, for you technically minded, grab the reop with git. Just make sure to also grab the submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:alexkingorg/wp-personal.git&lt;br /&gt;
cd wp-personal&lt;br /&gt;
git submodule update --init --recursive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/project/personal&quot;&gt;Personal Theme&lt;/a&gt;. View the project timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.3.1 also fixes twenty-six bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.3.1">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.3/?rev=34199&amp;stop_rev=33647">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.3.1</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.3.1.</p>

<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.4">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33573&amp;stop_rev=33396">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.4</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.4.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.3:</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version.

<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Site icons for all</em><br />

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.3.1 also fixes twenty-six bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.3.1">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.3/?rev=34199&amp;stop_rev=33647">list of changes</a>.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard.

<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>

&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.3:</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

	<title>Akismet: Akismet WordPress Plugin 3.1.4</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1873</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/09/24/akismet-3-1-4-wordpress/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Version 3.1.4 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the Akismet plugin for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; is now available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update clarifies the error messages that Akismet uses so that they&amp;#8217;re easier to understand, and it enables link previews in the admin for all links in a comment &amp;#8212; not just the author&amp;#8217;s website link. A fix is also included for a bug that could have caused comment moderation emails to be sent for some comments that were caught as spam.  For a full list of the changes in this release, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/akismet/trunk&quot;&gt;revision log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions. If you need to download the plugin zip file directly, links to all versions are available in &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the WordPress plugins directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1873&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WP Comment Humility Relocates the Comments Top-level Menu Item to the Posts Menu</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48313</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-comment-humility-relocates-the-comments-top-level-menu-item-to-the-posts-menu</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-billie-named-after-jazz-singer-billie-holiday-is-available-for-download&quot;&gt;features in WordPress 4.3&lt;/a&gt; is that comments on pages are disabled by default. If you only enable comments for posts, you may be interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;WP Comment Humility&lt;/a&gt;, a new plugin created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;John James Jacoby&lt;/a&gt; that moves the top-level Comments menu item to the Posts menu. The following screenshot better illustrates what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48314&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png?resize=429%2C378&quot; alt=&quot;Comment Humility in Action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Comment Humility in Action
&lt;p&gt;If a site enables comments for posts only, this location for the menu item makes sense. What if you&amp;#8217;re using Custom Post Types? According the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/faq/&quot;&gt;plugin&amp;#8217;s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, the user experience might be weird, &amp;#8220;If you have a post type other than &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; that supports comments, it may make more sense to not use this plugin,&amp;#8221; Jacoby said. He suggests giving it a try and if the user experience doesn&amp;#8217;t feel right, to disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/stuttter/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;located on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; where you can also submit Pull Requests. WP Comment Humility works out-of-the-box without any configuration options on WordPress 4.3 and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; in the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Highlights From Matt Mullenweg’s Q&amp;A Session on Product Hunt</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48303</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/highlights-from-matt-mullenwegs-qa-session-on-product-hunt</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;On September 22nd, Matt Mullenweg participated in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;question and answer session&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. Product Hunt is a site &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;that lets users share and discover new products. In the session, Mullenweg answers questions like what advice he&amp;#8217;d give to his 20 and 25-year-old self and how he combats burn out. Here are a few highlights from the session.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nikhil V&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Hello Matt, with the upcoming release of the WP REST API in WordPress core, what do you hope to most see built with its capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m hugely excited about the REST API! Once the infrastructure is in, I think we&amp;#8217;ll see really widespread adoption from plugins that right now are creating their endpoints in very ad-hoc ways. Once we iterate a bit more on the core content endpoints and authentication I think we&amp;#8217;ll see a lot more specialized interfaces built on WP as like a content kernel, an engine powering a wide array of applications and interfaces you&amp;#8217;d never imagine having WordPress behind them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erik Torenberg &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;If you could go back in time and give advice for your, say, 20-year-old self, what would you tell yourself? How about 25?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; To my 20-year-old self I would say to be okay with things building up over time. Something I didn&amp;#8217;t appreciate until recently is that there any many productive decades ahead with which to build the things that I feel need to exist in the world. One of the best things I did then was avoid any press or capitalization on my age (to the extent I could) because youth is an ephemeral asset and just a novelty in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my 25-year-old self I would tell him to slow down and think about health more, I burned the candle at both ends that year. I would also say to not get as caught up in mailing list and IRC arguments and discussions, just focus on building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sydney Liu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In the early days of WordPress, what was the 20% that got you the 80% of the results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; There&amp;#8217;s no simple answer there, if I had to pick one thing it would be &lt;em&gt;luck&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Kristof Bernaert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; How do you see WP about 5 years, or how do you want it to see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In 5 years I think that WP will be infinitely easier to use for both power-users, developers, and newbies. You will be able to have a full experience of core, plugins, themes, docs, and support in several dozen languages that will be as large or larger than English. There will be over a million people making their living on top of the platform. Most people will be creating from touch devices, and their content will mostly not come from keyboards (virtual or physical) as an input device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Tys Bradford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;&amp;#8211; Your accomplishments with WordPress have literally changed the face of the internet and enabled people without programming skills to make beautiful and functional websites. Do you think this could be replicated ever with mobile applications (iOS/Android)? I have seen a few companies try, but none have come close to delivering in the way WordPress is able to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Thank you! The ecosystems and app stores for iOS and Android right now are too locked down, and the discoverability and overhead of apps is too distorted, for an approach like WordPress&amp;#8217; to work for mobile applications. The environment for the foreseeable future there is going to favor more centralized apps, my only hope is that at least a few get really successful (including ours) that aren&amp;#8217;t advertising-driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Question Was Not Answered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my question was not answered. However, I&amp;#8217;m going to ask it in this post with the hope that he&amp;#8217;ll answer it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve spent a lot of time, money, and energy trying to create a great mobile experience in WordPress via dedicated apps. As more of the WordPress backend becomes responsive, how will this affect (if any) the priority level of developing the mobile apps versus putting that time and effort into a 100% responsive WordPress backend?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullenweg answers a lot more questions than what&amp;#8217;s listed above but those are the ones that stand out to me. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;read the entire session&lt;/a&gt; on the Product Hunt site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress REST API Is One Major Step Closer to Being Merged Into Core</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48284</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-rest-api-is-one-major-step-closer-to-being-merged-into-core</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After more than three years of development, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://v2.wp-api.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress REST API&lt;/a&gt; is one major step closer to getting merged into core. Ryan McCue, a lead contributor to the project, published the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;official proposal&lt;/a&gt; to merge the API into WordPress. The proposal explains what the REST API is, why it&amp;#8217;s needed, an integration plan, and what happens after the merge. The plan is to integrate the API in two stages, infrastructure and endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Part Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure is the code responsible for routing requests and handling the meta layer of the API, including JSON serialization/deserialization, linking, embedding, and REST best practices. Merging the infrastructure first allows developers to start building upon it and to migrate from existing custom code. The plan is to merge the infrastructure portion of the API in WordPress 4.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endpoints are considered the more complex of the two as they’re responsible for mapping data from the external JSON format to the internal data structures and vice versa. In other words, endpoints are the bridges of communication between WordPress and external applications. To provide more time for core committers to review the code, endpoints will be merged in WordPress 4.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of the API &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API&quot;&gt;takes place on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; but core WordPress development takes place on Subversion and Trac. When the API is merged into core, it will no longer be developed as a separate project. McCue proposes that the best of GitHub and Trac be integrated so developers comfortable with GitHub can continue to contribute to the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the team’s experience with GitHub as well as Trac, we can bring the best of both worlds by helping integrate the two. This would also improve contributions to WordPress as a whole, and benefit the whole community. This will be especially important as we encourage more contributions from the wider community (client authors, for example). We think we can make good progress here, and we’d love to try to help improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress&quot;&gt;GitHub repository for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;s synced to its Subversion counterpart, it does not accept pull requests. If integrating GitHub and Trac proves to be successful, it could open the door for WordPress to accept pull requests or contributions through GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan to merge the API into core is not finalized and the team needs your &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;comments, questions, and opinions&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage you to read the full proposal and the comments as McCue answers additional questions related to the merge. How happy are you to see this merge proposal?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The Impacts HeroPress Is Having on WordPress Communities in India</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48286</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-impacts-heropress-is-having-on-wordpress-communities-in-india</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Topher DeRosia, who recently attended&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia&quot;&gt; WordCamp Pune&lt;/a&gt;, India, &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/subtle-impacts/&quot;&gt;published a post on the HeroPress blog&lt;/a&gt; that describes the subtle impacts the project is having on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saurabh Shukla, lead organizer for WordCamp Pune, says the site inspired not only their speaker selection but their presentations as well, &amp;#8220;We wanted people to derive at least a level of inspiration from the speakers and decided that stories make more sense than presentations,&amp;#8221; Shukla said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of inspiring presentations at WordCamp Pune include, a workshop where people could experience accessibility issues for themselves, WordPress for activism, and building education products for South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Presentation in a Classroom at WordCamp Pune
&lt;p&gt;According to DeRosia, many Indians feel like their WordPress communities are not getting the respect they deserve. DeRosia believes the amount of excitement expressed by Indians for HeroPress is because their work is noticed and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;That&lt;/em&gt; is why India is excited about HeroPress. They’re getting respect. Not just from me, but from thousands of readers around the world,&amp;#8221; DeRosia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although DeRosia says he&amp;#8217;d be content with the impacts the site has had if HeroPress ended today, I would be sad to see it go  because it&amp;#8217;s a great addition to the WordPress community. Thankfully, DeRosia says people are requesting more essays, exchanges of knowledge, shared wisdom, shared respect, and more of the HeroPress spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an essay published on HeroPress or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;project&amp;#8217;s mission&lt;/a&gt; has inspired you in any way, please let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Interview, and Complementing Slack</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45326</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/09/complementing-slack/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.me/tonyconrad&quot;&gt;Tony Conrad&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strictlyvc.com/&quot;&gt;StrictlyVC&lt;/a&gt; event in San Francisco last week, following a dizzyingly talented line-up of &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/chamath-palihapitaya-on-insane-burn-rates-ipos-and-raising-a-new-real-estate-fund/&quot;&gt;Chamath Palihapitiya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dfj.com/content/steve-jurvetson&quot;&gt;Steve Jurvetson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/18/move-over-slack-automattic-mulls-commercializing-its-own-internal-messaging-product/&quot;&gt;Techcrunch has a good write-up with a number of the relevant quotes from the event&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing I&amp;#8217;d like to respond to, because it wasn&amp;#8217;t a direct quote, is the headline &amp;#8220;Move Over Slack? Automattic Mulls Commercializing Its Own Internal Messaging Product.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem is the headline missed the obvious alliteration of &amp;#8220;Mullenweg Mulls,&amp;#8221; &lt;img src=&quot;http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f600.png&quot; alt=&quot;😀&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;but more importantly&amp;#8230; &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; has become a really key tool for both Automattic &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;and WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt; and anything we do with the evolution of &lt;a href=&quot;http://p2theme.com/&quot;&gt;P2&lt;/a&gt; (some of which we already have running internally) will be complementary to Slack, not competitive with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jeff Yablon and the WordPress Foundation Settle Out of Court</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48267</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jeff-yablon-and-the-wordpress-foundation-settle-out-of-court</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation sued Jeff Yablon&lt;/a&gt; for trademark infringement. The Foundation wanted Yablon to stop using its trademarks, dismiss the opposition proceeding, pay the foundation for any profits related to use of the WordPress trademarks, pay up to $100,000 per infringing domain name, transfer the domains and pay other fees and damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline of Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 22nd, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=7&quot;&gt;Yablon filed a request&lt;/a&gt; for default judgement. On June 29th, the Foundation responded to Yablon by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=8&quot;&gt;asking the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board&lt;/a&gt; to deny Yablon&amp;#8217;s request for default judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 9th, David Mermelstein, Administrative Trademark Judge, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=9&quot;&gt;filed a response&lt;/a&gt; that not only denied Yablon&amp;#8217;s motion for default judgment, but also suspended proceedings until the civil case was complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With proceedings suspended, Yablon could no longer file motions or requests with the TTAB. The only option left was to proceed through court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Settlement Between Yablon and The Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 21st, Yablon and the WordPress Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudup.com/cLmq3DWS6MZ&quot;&gt;settled out of court&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48277&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png?resize=839%2C621&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of Settlement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sample of Settlement
&lt;h3&gt;Yablon&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the settlement, by no later than October 15th, Yablon agrees to cease any and all use of the WordPress name, logos, trademarks, and any other name or mark confusingly similar to the term WordPress or its logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also has to cease any and all use of the WordPress Marks, standing alone or in combination with other words or designs, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use in any company name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta-tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personalized URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyword Advertising on Yablon&amp;#8217;s websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media handles or account names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indoor outdoor store signage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letterhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stationary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon must also comply with the terms of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/&quot;&gt;WordPress trademark and domain name policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No later than five days after the effective date (Oct 15th), Yablon has to transfer all of the domains he owns that incorporate the WordPress Mark to the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Yablon acknowledges that the Foundation owns and has the exclusive rights in and to the WordPress marks in connection with the goods and services identified in each of WordPress&amp;#8217; registrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon can no longer do anything inconsistent with the Foundation&amp;#8217;s ownership of its WordPress Marks and registrations thereof, including but not limited to, contesting the Foundation&amp;#8217;s title to or the validity of the WordPress marks or the trademark registrations thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WordPress Foundation&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Yablon transfers the domains to the Foundation and does not breach the terms of the agreement, the Foundation will redirect the domains to a domain of Yablon&amp;#8217;s choosing for 6 months from the effective date or April 1, 2016, whichever comes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 10 days of the domains being transferred, the Foundation will file a stipulated request to withdrawal its U.S. Opposition Proceeding No. 91221895 without prejudice and Case 3:15-cv02745 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, without prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as Yablon does not breach the agreement, the Foundation agrees not to sue for violating its trademarks prior to the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation will not object to Yablon&amp;#8217;s use of the WordPress Marks as part of any subdomains or subdirectories associated with any second level domain name registered to and controlled exclusively by Yablon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples include but are not limited to, wordpress.answerguy.com or answerguy.com/wordpress in connection with services that involve use of the WordPress platform, support the WordPress brand services, and that do not otherwise violate the rights of the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parties agree to bear their own attorney&amp;#8217;s fees and costs, if any were incurred through the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;spoke to Yablon&lt;/a&gt; on the phone in June shortly after the lawsuit was filed, he sounded like he knew what he was getting into and the complexities involved with U.S. Trademarks. Yablon strongly believed he had enough evidence to pursue the matter and to see it through the court system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing the court case all the way through, he chose to give up which in the court system, is not the same thing as losing, as losing or winning sets a precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Yablon didn&amp;#8217;t lose the case, the WordPress Foundation didn&amp;#8217;t win either. It&amp;#8217;s a reminder that the Foundation will aggressively defend its trademarks in the court system if other means prove unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think Yablon’s mission to defend his use of WordPress in a top-level domain name and potentially open the door for others to do the same, was in the best interest of the WordPress community as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: Gravity Flow makes custom form administrative workflows simple</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14337</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/gravity-flow-makes-custom-form-administrative-workflows-simple/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;Gravity Flow&lt;/a&gt; is one of the coolest new plugins I&amp;#8217;ve seen in quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoices, purchase orders, job applications, and employee vacation requests are just a few potential applications for Gravity Flow, which makes form-centric approval, user input, and notification processes simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With Gravity Flow, you use the power of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; to design your forms, and you use Gravity Flow to design your process using easy to use drag-and-drop tools,&amp;#8221; the video states. The flows created in Gravity Flow can be customized to include all sorts of user-defined paths to request stakeholder feedback, get administrative approval, or fire off a notification that a certain step in the flow has been accomplished. It can even be integrated with other notification systems like Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that common to see a WordPress plugin (especially an add-on plugin) that simultaneously targets a niche and serves it so extensively. Gravity Flow is built to extend the powerful Gravity Forms product, and it really takes it an extra mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of potential for Gravity Flow for intranets and other corporate environments with lots of stakeholders and traditionally clunky, email based workflows for approval of common tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trying Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took Gravity Flow for a spin, because there is a handy demo site capability built in. For a plugin this complex, being able to test drive it is a really great feature. Most workflow tasks can take place either in the admin or on the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating workflows feels a lot like adding regular notifications to Gravity Forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14340&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-workflow-752x579.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workflows have many configuration and sending options. And each step can be sorted and arranged to follow a series of steps, and can even allow for delays (like for a scholarship review period, in my example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s the view for an administrator, but someone who is responsible for providing feedback or approval has a front-end view to directly interact with the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14339&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-review-update-workflow-752x872.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-review-update-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;872&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And administrators can see reports of activity for various workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14338&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-reports-752x552.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-reports&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;552&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty simple overview of the plugin, and I&amp;#8217;d recommend you &lt;a href=&quot;http://demo.gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the demo&lt;/a&gt;, or his full &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.gravityflow.io/category/34-walkthroughs&quot;&gt;walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; examples. but this at least highlights some of the plugin&amp;#8217;s power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Development of Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting things about Gravity Flow is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Henty&lt;/a&gt; made it. Steven actually works at Rocketgenius, the company behind Gravity Forms, and he is a developer of the main Gravity Forms product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to Steven about why this isn&amp;#8217;t a Gravity Forms official add-on, and what it&amp;#8217;s like working on a side project for your own company&amp;#8217;s product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocketgenius has a lot of plans and loads of really exciting stuff in the pipeline so it was a question of priorities &amp;#8211; Rocketgenius can’t possibly do absolutely everything at the same time. For me it’s a project that’s niche enough to be an interesting and profitable side project and yet not too time-consuming so I can continue to focus 100% on my day job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterated how important it is to him that he had his team behind him for this project. And Carl Hancock &amp;#8212; co-founder of Rocketgenius &amp;#8212; is excited about Steven&amp;#8217;s product as well, saying &amp;#8220;The product is awesome. It&amp;#8217;s definitely more complex [and] business oriented, but that&amp;#8217;s a good thing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl also shared that Steve has a background that lends itself to thinking about complex problems to solve, working on, &amp;#8220;more enterprise stuff pre-WordPress, on a wide variety of platforms and programming languages.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve did a great job with Gravity Flow, and I&amp;#8217;m happy to see it out there.  On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/gravity-flow/&quot;&gt;his personal blog&lt;/a&gt;, he highlights use cases for the product, which are real world examples based on how his first 100 beta testers are using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gravity ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Rocketgenius employees have Gravity Forms focused side projects, which I think is really cool. Another favorite of mine is David Smith&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://gravitywiz.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Wiz&lt;/a&gt;, that adds functionality snippets, or &amp;#8220;perks&amp;#8221;, to Gravity Forms. The third-party ecosystem is doing well too; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityplus.pro/&quot;&gt;Gravity Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityview.co/&quot;&gt;Gravity View&lt;/a&gt; are two healthy Gravity Forms focused businesses that come to mind, and I&amp;#8217;m sure there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main plugin continues to dominate the WordPress forms space. Though it is commercial only, it powers hundreds of thousands of websites, and has dozens of official &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/&quot;&gt;add-ons&lt;/a&gt;. Carl has told me many times he doesn&amp;#8217;t even view most other WordPress forms plugins as competition (though newer entrants like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ninjaforms.com/&quot;&gt;Ninja Forms&lt;/a&gt; are doing quite well for themselves), as Gravity Forms aims to take marketshare away from complex hosted solutions like Wufoo, rather than gobble up the much larger but less demanding market that just wants simple contact forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up with Gravity Flow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the website&lt;/a&gt;. And the project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stevehenty/gravityflow&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt; as well, as Steve is billing for support and automatic upgrades, which starts at €87 (around $100) per year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems like the longest days are those in between an Apple announcement and when the products are actually available. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to iOS 9, WatchOS 2, 6s+, Apple TV&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Recap of WordCamp Pune, India, by Topher DeRosia</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48212</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48213&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; href=&quot;http://topher1kenobe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Topher DeRosia&lt;/a&gt;. Topher has contributed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe#content-plugins&quot;&gt;number of plugins&lt;/a&gt;, spoken at many WordCamps, and is the lead of documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://easydigitaldownloads.com/&quot;&gt;Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/a&gt; He also operates &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/&quot;&gt;HeroPress.com&lt;/a&gt; on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last July, the lead organizer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pune.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Pune, India &lt;/a&gt;asked if I would come and speak about HeroPress. This post isn&amp;#8217;t going to be about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;HeroPress&lt;/a&gt; nor about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/category/wordcamp/pune/&quot;&gt;my adventures on the trip&lt;/a&gt;. No, this post is going to be about a WordCamp in a relatively large city in India, how it compares to American WordCamps, and some things that were experimented with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Similarities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, WordCamp Pune is exactly like every other WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve been to. The night before the event, there was a speaker dinner with excellent food and wonderful company. Registration was chaotic because WiFi was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone was happy and excited to be there, and it was very loud because everyone wanted to be part of a conversation. It had all the elements I love about WordCamps; handshakes between new friends, hugs between old friends, and huge transfers of information between everyone, it was fantastic. Aside from WordCamp Miami, it&amp;#8217;s also the largest WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended with 500 tickets sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was well-organized, by which I mean things were well planned for, and handled well when they didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Sessions were held in university class rooms. I think they were a little small for the number of attendees, but it didn&amp;#8217;t detract from the experience. Here&amp;#8217;s an example of a room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s Ramya Pandyan talking about being a better blogger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended where the sessions were in a variety of languages. I would expect this in a place like WordCamp EU, but to have it be a variety of &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; languages was fascinating to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unofficial time zone of India is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/04/28/india-journal-understanding-ist-indian-stretchable-time/&quot;&gt;Indian Stretchable Time&lt;/a&gt;. On the first day of WordCamp, Saurabh worked hard to keep things on schedule. We started 30 minutes late, but on Foundation Day, things got started an hour late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was full of people sitting and waiting patiently, but starting on time was &lt;strong&gt;not expected&lt;/strong&gt;. In the US, I would have expected a lot more cranky people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things were heavily guarded. The main venue was quite open, but to get into Foundation Day, I had to let these guys check me with a magnetic wand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48219&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png?resize=904%2C510&quot; alt=&quot;Indian Policemen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then 20 feet away sign in at a guard house, and then 30 feet beyond that show my ID inside the front door of the venue. This kind of thing also happened at restaurants and every time I went into my hotel. No-one was ever aggressive or suspicious, it&amp;#8217;s just something that happened and everyone took it in stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Word Lounge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48220&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png?resize=298%2C462&quot; alt=&quot;Word Lounge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There was a room set aside to be an all day open session for writers. There&amp;#8217;s a local group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlphabetSambar&quot;&gt;Alphabet Sambar&lt;/a&gt; (Sambar is a soup) that has a regular meetup to help each other with writing. They made sure to welcome attendees and keep a good discussion going all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this idea of unconference rooms based on topic. Some people thrive on the group communication that can come from that format, and I&amp;#8217;d love to see other topical open forums at other WordCamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The After Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of quiet after parties, so I can talk to people. I can also appreciate people wanting a pretty intense party atmosphere. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/crccpune&quot;&gt;Classic Rock Coffee Co.&lt;/a&gt; offered both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had three large areas, the largest being almost 6000 sq. ft., one about 800 sq. ft., and an ampitheater with seating for about 100 where they had live classic rock bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was a closed in area with seating for about 40 people that felt more like a cafe or restaurant. The larger open areas had a full bar and restaurant. Except for the cafe, the whole place had a fabric roof which is less sturdy than canvas. It had an outdoors feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at a table of about 15 people and had no trouble communicating with any of them. I was probably 130 feet from the music and it was well contained. I was able to communicate without noise being an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of people sat at tables, in the cafe, in the ampitheater; wherever they were most comfortable. It was probably my favorite after-party venue of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia#gallery-48212-1-slideshow&quot;&gt;Click to view slideshow.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bits and Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult thing for me was trying to discern people through their accents. Just about everyone had a solid handle on English, but there&amp;#8217;s a mental fatigue that comes from parsing the words through an accent. The longer you do it, the harder it gets, especially with sleep deprivation. I tried not to be rude, and people were patient with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a photo area with some crazy hats and people seemed to have a really good time with it. I can see it working at other WordCamps as well. The ladies from Hummingbird got one of me in a crazy hat, but I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48226&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png?resize=1025%2C578&quot; alt=&quot;Crazy Hat Picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was prepared on-site in realtime and it worked. It was mostly sandwiches, and the food prep people took a request, made the sandwich, and handed it to the person in moments. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have expected it to work that smoothly, but it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit and bottled water were available just about all the time, which was nice since it was pretty hot that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the food and language, this WordCamp didn&amp;#8217;t feel all that foreign to me. I suspect it&amp;#8217;s because WordCamps have a solid template for sessions, scheduling, etc. I enjoyed that, it enabled me to really take part in the event without having to stand to the side wondering what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers seemed to be on the ball and did a great job sharing the responsibilities, which I think is vital with a camp this size. The people were engaged, took full advantage of the options available to them, and &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; is what made it a successful WordCamp in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever get the chance to attend a WordCamp in a culture other than your own, I highly recommend you jump at the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Look Inside the Offices of 16 People Who Work With WordPress on a Daily Basis</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48204</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-look-inside-the-offices-of-16-people-who-work-with-wordpress-on-a-daily-basis</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a remote worker environment, people have the choice to work from home or wherever it&amp;#8217;s convenient. Syed Waseem Abbas published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://torquemag.io/inside-the-workplaces-of-16-wordpress-community-mavens/&quot;&gt;guest post on Torquemag,&lt;/a&gt; that looks at the offices of 16 people who work with WordPress on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the offices are classy while others are small. Many of the people featured in the post use one or more Apple products. If you&amp;#8217;re curious as to what my setup looks like, here you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48205&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg?resize=960%2C720&quot; alt=&quot;My Home Office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My Home Office
&lt;p&gt;Most of the work I do is on a Windows 7 Professional 64bit desktop PC with two 23-inch monitors. When I work remotely, I use a fully loaded 15-inch MacBook Pro with retina display from 2013. As a devoted Windows user, I feel like I&amp;#8217;m part of a dying breed, especially within the WordPress ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For WordPress Weekly, I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000PTF0E2&quot;&gt;Samson CO1U&lt;/a&gt; USB powered condenser microphone connected to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/musical-instruments/dp/B001D7UYBO/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442008126&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Rode+Swivel+mount&quot;&gt;Rode PSA1 swivel mount&lt;/a&gt; with a boom arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predominantly work in a sitting position which is why I&amp;#8217;m in the market for a standing desk where the height can be easily adjusted. I&amp;#8217;m also looking for a new office chair where the arm rests don&amp;#8217;t disintegrate within the first year of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions, let me know in the comments. Also, if you need inspiration to create the perfect office environment, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://officetoday.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Office Today&lt;/a&gt;. Office Today features remote offices and locations from across the world used by Automattic employees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: bbPress 2015 Survey Results Show Users Want Attachments, Better Moderation Tools</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48180</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/bbpress-2015-survey-results-show-users-want-attachments-better-moderation-tools</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The bbPress development team &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2015/09/2015-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;published the results&lt;/a&gt; of its 2015 survey. This year, 213 people participated which is 30 more &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2014/05/2014-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;than last year&lt;/a&gt;. After reviewing, replacing, and removing some questions from the 2014 survey, this year&amp;#8217;s survey has 25 questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of survey question types were used to gather the data including, multiple choices, check boxes, text fields, email box, and open‐ended questions. Empty forms were deleted and those marked as incomplete were reviewed individually. Submissions that had no responses on the second and third pages of the survey were excluded from the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highlights From the Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of respondents use bbPress 2.5 and above with WordPress 4.2 and above. Seventy-one percent of participants using bbPress &amp;lt;=1.x.x are also using the latest version of WordPress. This data indicates bbPress users are vigilant in keeping their sites up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of who uses bbPress, 51% of respondents use it on their own sites while 30% create sites with bbPress forums for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48182&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png?resize=485%2C249&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress 2015 Survey Users&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress 2015 Survey Who Uses bbPress
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, the top three languages used are English 74%, German 7%, and French 6.5%. Three-fourths or 75% of bbPress installations are within WordPress either in the domain root, physical directory, or physical subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining 25% are on multisite installations where more than half have activated bbPress network-wide and the rest in multiple networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48183&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg?resize=900%2C237&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress User Installations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress User Installations
&lt;p&gt;One statistic I&amp;#8217;m proud of is that 29% of the respondents found out about the survey through WP Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48184&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png?resize=854%2C328&quot; alt=&quot;How People Found Out About The Survey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The most wanted features in a bbPress theme are, Responsive (69.5%), Light and Fresh Design (52%), and Compatible with the latest bbPress version (49%). A preference for Responsive, mobile-first themes is in fourth place at 39%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, Attachments (42.5%), Ajaxification of Topics and Replies (41.5%), and Moderation tools in the front end (39%) are the most requested features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48196&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png?resize=463%2C219&quot; alt=&quot;2015 Most Requested Features&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2015 Most Requested Features
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of bbPress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercime, a BuddyPress and bbPress core contributor, confirmed at the end of the survey that the bbPress project is alive and well. According to Mercime, the development team is in the middle of a large migration project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/src/humans.txt&quot;&gt;bbPress core team&lt;/a&gt; has been involved in the process of migrating the WordPress Support Forums (English and all Rosetta sites) from bbPress 1.x.x to bbPress 2.5.8 starting with one European-language forums subsite which has been already ported and being tested on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this migration has been discussed many times and often over the years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;@johnjamesjacoby&lt;/a&gt; formally started the process when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/05/15/wp-org-forums-plugins-audit/&quot;&gt;posted the results of an audit&lt;/a&gt; to show the custom functionality required for a successful migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involves multiple teams including, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;WP Support team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/&quot;&gt;WP Meta Team&lt;/a&gt;. The migration will impact more than 8 million users on WordPress.org. Any improvements made to bbPress to ease the migration process are going to be merged back into the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Confirms It Did Not Have a Security Breach</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48173</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpml-confirms-it-did-not-have-a-security-breach</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When WPML emailed new &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext&quot;&gt;passwords to customers in plaintext&lt;/a&gt;, some customers thought it was due to a security breach. Amit Kvint, compatibility team leader for WPML, confirmed the emails are not a result of a security breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/2015/09/password-update-email-from-wpml/&quot;&gt;post on the official WPML blog&lt;/a&gt;, Kvint says the emails were a preventive measure to insure accounts remain secure, &amp;#8220;The main purpose and underlying principle for this action was making sure everyone has a good new strong password, we consider this an important step in online security,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvint acknowledges the improvements in WordPress 4.3 in how passwords are handled and admits that sending passwords in plaintext was not a good idea, &amp;#8220;The best practice would be, once the password is sent, to login and reset the password to a new strong one. We will definitely revise the way this is done in the future,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog post does not go into detail in how they determined passwords to be weak. To the best of my knowledge, WPML does not have a policy in place to enforce strong passwords. While no accounts were compromised, if some of the contacted customers choose a weak password, wouldn&amp;#8217;t it defeat the purpose of resetting passwords in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jetpack 3.7 Introduces a Simpler Interface, Adds Support for Development Sites</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48161</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-7-introduces-a-simpler-interface-adds-support-for-development-sites</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/2015/09/09/jetpack-3-7-simpler-ui-support-for-development-sites-and-more/&quot;&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt; and includes a simpler user interface, support for development sites, and fixes several issues with a variety of modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new interface separates some of Jetpack&amp;#8217;s functionality into categories such as, performance and security, traffic growth, and WordPress.com tools. The most commonly used modules are listed first with a link underneath that takes users to the other 27 modules and the old settings page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48162&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png?resize=968%2C492&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack 3.7 Interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack 3.7 Interface
&lt;p&gt;Turning a module on or off is accomplished by clicking a toggle. Services you need to pay for are clearly marked with links to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest drawbacks to Jetpack is switching between a local server or staging environment. If you move your site from one URL to another, Jetpack automatically detects the change and prompts the user to confirm if the URL is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48163&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png?resize=1025%2C155&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack on a staging site&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack on a staging site
&lt;p&gt;If Jetpack thinks two URLs are separate websites, it recommends that you create a new connection to prevent a service interruption on the original domain. The prompt has links to reset the connection, confirm that the URL is part of a development environment, or submit a trouble ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48164&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png?resize=1025%2C143&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites
&lt;p&gt;The VideoPress player in Jetpack 3.7 works on mobile devices thanks to its responsive redesign. Having VideoPress enabled allows you to easily embed VideoPress powered videos to your site by copying and pasting the video&amp;#8217;s URL into the visual editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other changes included in 3.7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to enable per-post opt-out for Subscriptions by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/support/subscriptions/#filters&quot;&gt;adding a filter&lt;/a&gt; to a functionality plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new Widget Visibility rule that allows you to show or hide widgets based on a page’s parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing buttons now display on bbPress forum posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; from the WordPress plugin directory. To view a list of all the changes in this release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/changelog/&quot;&gt;check out the changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Conceptual WordPress Plugin by Stephen Cronin That Makes Comment Moderation Easier</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48149</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-conceptual-wordpress-plugin-by-stephen-cronin-that-makes-comment-moderation-easier</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Moderating replies to comments in the backend of WordPress is tough. For example, WordPress 4.3 displays the reply and who it&amp;#8217;s in response too, but doesn&amp;#8217;t show the text of the parent comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t see the parent comment unless you open the author link in a new browser tab. This is not an optimal user experience and makes it more difficult to determine if the reply is from a spammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48150&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png?resize=851%2C161&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;Show Parent Comment&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Cronin, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/&quot;&gt;Scratch99 Design&lt;/a&gt;, is a potential solution to the problem. Simply activate and browse to the comment section of the WordPress backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show Parent Comment displays the text of the parent comment inside the reply. This helps moderators keep track of the conversation and helps to identify copy/paste spammers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48151&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png?resize=847%2C223&quot; alt=&quot;Show Parent Comment Plugin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easy Way to See The Parent Comment
&lt;p&gt;While the plugin works as advertised and shows the parent comment text, the interface needs to be improved. I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of the background color and some of the comment information is repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea is to replace the &lt;strong&gt;In Reply to Author&lt;/strong&gt; text to say, &lt;strong&gt;In Response To&lt;/strong&gt;. The show more or less button is a good idea but I think the text size needs to be increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Show Parent Comment is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;plugin directory for free&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s a proof of concept and is not officially supported by Cronin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept needs work but I think something similar needs to be added to WordPress core. As it stands, moderating comment replies is not a great experience and I think Cronin&amp;#8217;s plugin is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Emails Passwords to Affected Customers in Plaintext</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48123</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-31477&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png?resize=637%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Clear Text Password&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/thegloaming/1402099967/&quot;&gt;thegloaming&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;Customers who purchased &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/&quot;&gt;WPML&lt;/a&gt;, a multilingual plugin for WordPress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-699832&quot;&gt;are receiving&lt;/a&gt; a suspicious email that looks similar to a phishing attempt. Matt Radford, a customer of WPML, kindly sent the Tavern a copy of the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Matt&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure that your WPML account remains secure. For this, we are updating all client accounts with auto-generated strong passwords. A strong password helps prevent unauthorized use of your WPML account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our system will start the password update shortly. We will send you another email with your new password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WPML team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radford received a follow-up email that includes his new password in plaintext. WPML explains why the passwords were sent in plaintext, &amp;#8220;We detected weak passwords in our system and following this we are enforcing, on a one-time procedure, strong passwords to all our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As for sending them in plaintext, if you consider it not to be safe, please update your password in order to keep it secure,&amp;#8221; WPML said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When questioned if passwords are stored in plaintext within the database, WPML replied, &amp;#8220;As for storing passwords in our database we are not storing it in plaintext, we are using standard WordPress. Yes they&amp;#8217;re salted and hashed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise VanDeCruze, a WPML support forum moderator, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-700143&quot;&gt;the email was generated automatically&lt;/a&gt; from their systems. She confirms that sending passwords in plaintext is not a best practice and urges users to login to their accounts and generate a new password using the reset password link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This email was automatically generated by our system and sent to clients with passwords that were deemed too simple. However, sending new passwords in plain text via email without requiring user action is not best practice. I urge you to change your WPML account password. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were right to be cautious of this sudden email. Although it was not a phishing attempt, it was not the best way to ensure a safe password. In the future we will be mindful of adhering to strict security standards. Please let me know if you have any further questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WPML has not published any information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/blog/&quot;&gt;its blog&lt;/a&gt; that explains the situation and has yet to respond to our requests for comment. If you&amp;#8217;re a WPML customer and receive an email with a new password, you should immediately login and generate a new password using the site&amp;#8217;s reset password link and follow the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emailing passwords in plaintext is a terrible security practice. One of the key improvements in WordPress 4.3 is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/&quot;&gt;WordPress no longer emails passwords&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it sends password reset links that expire after 24 hours. In hindsight, WPML should have generated and sent password reset emails to affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Help Me Add Comment Approval Notifications to WordPress</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48059</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/help-me-add-comment-approval-notifications-to-wordpress</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy&quot;&gt;enabling comment moderation&lt;/a&gt; on the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;ve discovered that WordPress does not notify commenters when their comments are approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;m using the &lt;a title=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot;&gt;Comment Approved&lt;/a&gt; plugin by &lt;a title=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot; href=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot;&gt;Niels van Renselaar&lt;/a&gt;. It allows me to create a custom notification message that is sent when a comment is approved. Unfortunately, I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s working. Please let me know if you&amp;#8217;ve received any comment approval emails from the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe this feature should be in core. I&amp;#8217;ve started the process by creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717&quot;&gt;feature request ticket&lt;/a&gt; on WordPress trac. Let&amp;#8217;s discuss the pros and cons or why you think it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be in core. Please give me your feedback in the comments or within the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: How Chris Klosowski’s Lifestyle Changed by Writing One WordPress Plugin</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48051</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/how-chris-klosowskis-lifestyle-changed-by-writing-one-wordpress-plugin</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Klosowski, co-lead developer of Easy Digital Downloads, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kungfugrep.com/2015/09/how-writing-one-plugin-changed-my-lifestyle/&quot;&gt;explains how writing one plugin&lt;/a&gt; changed his lifestyle. He left his corporate job to be a full-time distributed worker and being a distributed worker comes with its own set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My truest challenge in this new lifestyle is knowing when it’s time to ignore Slack, shut off email, take off the Pebble, and just spend time with my family. It’s a challenge I’m learning to face, and the hardest part is admitting to myself that it’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s come up in conversation a couple times with my wife, and every time, she lets me know when I’m failing. Honesty here is the key. Not guilt, not anger, just brutal honesty of when I’m not being the best husband and dad because I’m putting work before them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges a distributed worker faces is figuring out the balance between work, family, and personal life. If you&amp;#8217;re struggling to find balance, I encourage you to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-mantra-of-family-comes-first&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and the nearly 100 comments that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments are from people in similar positions trying to figure out how to balance work, life, and family. After nearly three years of being a distributed worker, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Bug in Chrome 45 Causes WordPress Admin Menu to Break</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48045</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-bug-in-chrome-45-causes-wordpress-admin-menu-to-break</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Within the last five weeks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33199&quot;&gt;several people have reported&lt;/a&gt; an issue in Chrome that breaks the WordPress admin menu. If you hover the mouse cursor over menu items in the sidebar, they&amp;#8217;ll occasionally fall out-of-place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48046&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png?resize=764%2C543&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome WordPress Admin Menu &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using Chrome 45.0.2454.85, I&amp;#8217;m able to inconsistently reproduce the behaviour reported in the ticket. Through the process of elimination, users discovered Chrome is the software at fault and not WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179#c17&quot;&gt;source of the problem&lt;/a&gt; stems from Slimming Paint which is enabled by default in Chrome 45. Disabling slimming paint fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable this feature, visit &lt;strong&gt;chrome://flags/#disable-slimming-paint&lt;/strong&gt; in Chrome and &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Disable slimming paint&lt;/em&gt; option, and make sure the other two &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; options are disabled because they will override the Disable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds confusing, please refer to the following screenshot provided by Samuel Wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48056&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png?resize=839%2C185&quot; alt=&quot;Disable Slimming Paint Options&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Disable Slimming Paint Options
&lt;p&gt;Chrome&amp;#8217;s development team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179&amp;q=label%3AM-47%20slimming%20paint&amp;colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified&quot;&gt;aware of the issue&lt;/a&gt; and is working towards a solution that is marked for release in Chrome 47. Until then, users are encouraged to disable Slimming Paint until Chrome fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Dashboard Widget That Displays New Registered Users</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48037</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-dashboard-widget-that-displays-new-registered-users</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you run a WordPress site with user registration enabled and want to see recently registered accounts from the dashboard, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/new-user-dashboard/&quot;&gt;New User Dashboard Widget plugin&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/swadeshswain/&quot;&gt;Swadeshswain&lt;/a&gt;. After installing and activating the plugin, a new registered user widget appears on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48038&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png?resize=536%2C146&quot; alt=&quot;New Registered User Widget&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New Registered User Widget
&lt;p&gt;The widget tells you a user&amp;#8217;s registration date, name, and role. If you don&amp;#8217;t see the widget after activating the plugin, click on the Screen Options tab and make sure the box next to New User is checked. New User Dashboard Widget is the type of plugin that does one thing only and does it well. There&amp;#8217;s nothing to configure and it works out-of-the-box with WordPress 4.3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Proposal to Overhaul the Shortcode API in WordPress Goes Back to the Drawing Board</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48026</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/proposal-to-overhaul-the-shortcode-api-in-wordpress-goes-back-to-the-drawing-board</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/miqrogroove&quot;&gt;Robert Chapin&lt;/a&gt;, who contributes to WordPress core, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;published the first draft&lt;/a&gt; of a roadmap that explains how the Shortcode API could be overhauled. &amp;#8220;The decision to create this roadmap arose from specific needs that are not met by the old code,&amp;#8221; Chapin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has an aggressive timeline with development starting in WordPress 4.4 and ending in WordPress 4.7. In WordPress 4.4, a new syntax would be introduced that provides opportunities to make significant changes to the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of shortcodes that use the new syntax.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Self-Closing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode attr1=&amp;#8221;value1&amp;#8243; attr2=&amp;#8217;value2&amp;#8242; &amp;#8220;value3&amp;#8221; &amp;#8216;value4&amp;#8217; value5}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Enclosures&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${encl2}$] HTML [${encl3}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escaped Code&lt;/strong&gt;: [!{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the WordPress 4.5 development cycle, the focus would be to deprecate the old syntax, &amp;#8220;Plugins that register shortcodes without declaring support for new features will raise debugging errors to alert developers that support for the old shortcode syntax is ending,&amp;#8221; Chapin said. Posts using the old syntax would  continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the WordPress 4.6 update process, shortcodes using the old syntax would be converted to use the new syntax. The Shortcode API would continue to provide deprecated support for the old syntax to provide a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important point to note is that the new syntax does not support HTML inside of shortcode attributes. This leaves the potential for many sites to break as shortcodes may not perform the same way prior to WordPress 4.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition process ends with WordPress 4.7 where support for the old syntax is eliminated. Shortcodes and plugins that use the old syntax would stop working. During the WordPress 4.7 update process, a second attempt would be made to upgrade old content to use the new syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Proposal Raises Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has drawn constructive criticism from several members of the WordPress community. Nick Haskins, founder of Aesop Interactive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27426&quot;&gt;voiced his concern&lt;/a&gt; saying the syntax isn&amp;#8217;t easier for authors to use and will affect a large number of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://halfelf.org/&quot;&gt;Mika Epstein&lt;/a&gt;, who voluntarily moderates the WordPress.org support forums and interacts with users on a daily basis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27472&quot;&gt;sums up a list of concerns&lt;/a&gt; that many developers agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the plugins and themes on the planet we will break (because we will, they won’t read or test). We have to degrade them as gracefully as humanly possibly. Continuing to say “Well the developers were notified and should have updated” now that we’re as big as we are is not sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the very (legitimately) angry end users who are broken because they didn’t upgrade plugins and themes (or the themes/plugins didn’t get updated). People were rightly angry last time. It’s the end users, not the developers, who will be hardest hit by this change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating clearly to the users that it’s now &lt;code&gt;{{gallery}}&lt;/code&gt;. That’s going to be very hard. Incredibly hard. Updating their old posts (keeping in mind Justin’s Markdown caveat and those who use them as an aside – I know I know) is easier than making sure everyone knows what to do. At best we can keep tabs on the ones built into WP and perhaps use the logic we have in the visual editor NOW to convert them, but we have to figure out how to make sure everyone knows. This is nothing like the move of Menus to customizer. That was confusing, but the users could see what happened. This is a legit change, your old way is no longer going to work. That is huge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of users who have premium themes and plugins that &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; get update alerts. These people are simply not going to know they need to update and this is not their fault. We should never be breaking them if there’s possibly any alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users will be upgraded by their hosts vis-a-vis one-click installs and managed hosting so they will have up to date WP and out of date plugins/themes. So yes, many users will be on 4.7 and then a theme from 2014. It sucks, it’s the reality, we know it’s the reality, we cannot stick our heads in the sand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugins that are already using {{template}} tags in their code. Yeah, I’ve seen it. Most of them use it for search/replace within their own code, but we’ll want to make sure we check for everyone in the repo who might be doing it on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best argument against using the new shortcode syntax is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27518&quot;&gt;made by Stefano Agiletti.&lt;/a&gt; Agiletti says Italian keyboards don&amp;#8217;t have keys that create curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe English people don’t know that { and } are not present in all keyboards directly as the [ and ] are. On Italian keyboards [ and ] are generated using ALT-GR+è or ALT-GR++ and keyboards show ALT-GR basic sign like €@## and [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get { and } you need to type ALT-GR+SHIFT+è and ALT-GR+SHIFT++. Most people don’t know about this combination (I think only those who write code do) and the parentheses are not written on any key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the Drawing Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a considerable amount of feedback and concerns shared by developers, the proposal is heading back to the drawing board. In a comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27484&quot;&gt;summarizing the feedback&lt;/a&gt;, Andrew Nacin confirms that the new shortcode syntax does not fit the core team&amp;#8217;s vision of being easy and intuitive for non-technical authors to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he cautions that the team needs to do something, &amp;#8220;The proposed syntax significantly clashes with the proposed vision and given all of your feedback, we’re clearly going to have to go back to the drawing board. Please note that &lt;strong&gt;we still need to do something&lt;/strong&gt;, but maybe we can think further outside the box.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly encourage you to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;proposal and the comments&lt;/a&gt; that follow it. It&amp;#8217;s a great read that highlights how difficult it will be to make changes to the Shortcode API that don&amp;#8217;t end up causing a lot of sites to break.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48012</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who regularly comment on the Tavern may have noticed that your comments don&amp;#8217;t show up immediately after submitting them. That&amp;#8217;s because about four weeks ago, for the first time in the Tavern&amp;#8217;s history, comment moderation for all comments was enabled. I enabled moderation to address concerns raised by members of the community and to sleep better at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the request of a few readers and to be more transparent, I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/comment-policy&quot;&gt;comment moderation policy&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of at least a dozen people, I&amp;#8217;ve crafted a policy that is easy to read and more importantly, easy to follow. It explains our expectations, has a few tips on writing better comments, and lists possible reasons a comment may be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;&gt;CC0 licensed&lt;/a&gt; which is the least restrictive license offered by Creative Commons. Feel free to copy and modify it for your own use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strive to create a fun, friendly, and inviting atmosphere. The ground rules for commenting on WP Tavern are simple. Treat people the way you want to be treated. Try to understand someone else’s perspective and if you disagree, respectfully explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text is a difficult medium to decipher context. Emoticons and emoji help, but it doesn’t solve the problem. Take a deep breath and assume the commenter has the best of intentions before responding and approach discussions with open minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome different perspectives and viewpoints but we all need to clearly communicate them without tearing the opposition down in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay on point using concise language. If your comment is more than a few paragraphs long, consider publishing it on your own site instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your comment may be deleted if it matches any of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocates an illegal practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses vulgar, profane, or unnecessarily harsh language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is spam or appears to be written primarily to post a link or advertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is written anonymously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains copyrighted material not licensed for distribution on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impersonates another user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains an affiliate link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal insults, including those using racist or sexist terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines are not meant to be an exhaustive list. The deletion of comments is wholly within the discretion of the moderators at WP Tavern and we will err on the side of maintaining a safe and friendly community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;How Do I Report Comments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe a comment published on WP Tavern violates any of the listed guidelines or that you feel needs special attention, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/contact-me&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;. Please do not publicly report comments using social media such as Facebook or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form submissions are sent to authors with comment moderation capabilities. Include a link to the comment in your email with a short explanation as to why it needs our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to reestablish the comment section as a place where people feel welcome to voice their opinions without the fear of being ripped apart. We encourage criticism, disagreements, and open conversation but it needs to take place in a respectful manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: A Day of REST — a conference devoted to the WordPress REST API</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14173</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/a-day-of-rest-a-conference-devoted-to-the-wordpress-rest-api/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;A Day of REST&lt;/a&gt; will be the first ever event dedicated to the WordPress REST API. It&amp;#8217;ll happen on January 28th 2016, with a follow-on hack day on the 29th, and will be held at Bishopsgate Institute in London, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is aimed at developers who want to learn how to interact with the new WordPress REST API. From WordPress developers to Javascript developers, to application developers, A Day of REST promises to provide in-depth information that covers every aspect of the WordPress REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of event I&amp;#8217;ve been hoping to see in the WordPress community. Sessions will vary from an introduction to the WordPress REST API to in-depth case studies and guides on utilizing it in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an incredible and rare opportunity to learn from the people making the API and those extending it further than anyone else. A niche event to be sure, A Day of REST  is a big bet on the WordPress REST API &amp;#8212; which is not yet slated for core, but is widely expected to make it to core in the next few releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference is being organized to supply a clear demand for more information, resources, and education on the subject. At most WordCamps, REST API sessions seem to be some of the most crowded, with the most engaged and curious audiences. A Day of REST will be like those sessions, but much bigger, as the entire day will be dedicated to the single topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is speaking at A Day of REST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14179&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/speakers-day-of-rest-752x603.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;speakers-day-of-rest&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker roster consists of people who are building the WordPress REST API, and those who are already using it for production applications and websites. The speakers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan McCue &amp;#8211;  WordPress REST API co-lead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Hoyle &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Bachhuber &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen Vignos &amp;#8211; Director of Engineering, WIRED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K. Adam White &amp;#8211; Open Web Engineer, Bocoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Lenox &amp;#8211; Design Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Taylor &amp;#8211; Senior Engineer, New York Times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski &amp;#8211; Meta Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post Status will be an official partner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really pleased that Post Status will be the official content partner for A Day of REST. That means I’ll be attending the event, and I&amp;#8217;ll offer a number of in-depth posts related to the WordPress REST API, the sessions, interviews, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll also manage content for some of the larger event announcements, like this one. I&amp;#8217;ve known the organizers for a long time, and they are big supporters of Post Status. A Day of REST offers a really great opportunity for me to work with them and offer my readers some unique privileges and exclusive content for a subject that&amp;#8217;s of interest to most of my audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So who is organizing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14180&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/humans-752x333.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;humans&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/organizations/human-made/&quot;&gt;Human Made&lt;/a&gt;, who’ve brought on board &lt;a href=&quot;http://siobhanmckeown.com/about/&quot;&gt;Siobhan McKeown&lt;/a&gt; to lead the charge putting the event together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Made uses the API in a good bit of their services and product work, are really interested to see more adoption of the API, and are eager to provide education resources so that can happen. Those of you who pay close attention may know that two of Human Made&amp;#8217;s own are actually part of the team of four that does much of the REST API development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rmccue&quot;&gt;Ryan McCue&lt;/a&gt; is the project co-lead, and is generally steering the ship; the API started as his GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle&quot;&gt;Joe Hoyle&lt;/a&gt; is in day to day conversations for project direction and also commits a lot of code to the API; he is a co-founder of Human Made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hack Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 29th January 2016, there will be a WordPress REST API hack day. This event is being hosted by Mozilla Spaces in London. Space for the hack day is limited but the team would love for anyone interested to come along and help make the WordPress REST API. Bring a laptop and expect to get hacking. This event will be for building the REST API specifically, and not geared toward other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ticket details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/tickets/&quot;&gt;from the website&lt;/a&gt;. They’re £125 (+ VAT &amp;amp; booking fees) &amp;#8212; which ends up being around $235 US &amp;#8212; and the price includes all of the usual conference goodies: presentations, lunch, swag, and an informal afterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confirmed sponsors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is excited to already have some awesome sponsors on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prospress.com/&quot;&gt;ProsPress&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sucuri.net/&quot;&gt;Sucuri&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is also looking for more sponsors to get involved and help make this unique event happen. If you’d like to sponsor, send an email to events@humanmade.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the content, you can get updates either from this blog, or from the A Day of REST website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;feelingrestful.com&lt;/a&gt;. You should also follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/feelingrestful&quot;&gt;@feelingrestful&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for live updates. I&amp;#8217;ll have in-depth content and broader event information and the event site will have more general announcements, news, and event updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is quite accessible from much of the world, so I am hopeful and confident that there will be a diverse audience in attendance. I certainly look forward to visiting; and I was pleasantly surprised that it doesn&amp;#8217;t get as cold there as I thought; January temperatures (lows and highs) stay around the 40s (F, or 5-9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_default&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_unit_c&quot;&gt;°&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; C) &amp;#8212; which is likely warmer than it&amp;#8217;ll be where I live in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is an exciting development in the WordPress conference ecosystem and I&amp;#8217;m confident it&amp;#8217;s going to be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Envato Implements Item Support Policy for ThemeForest and CodeCanyon</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47990</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/envato-implements-item-support-policy-for-themeforest-and-codecanyon</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In August of 2014, Envato &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/news/item-support-sustainability-authors-clarity-buyers/&quot;&gt;announced a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; that would allow sellers on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codecanyon.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;CodeCanyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;ThemeForest&lt;/a&gt; to inform buyers whether or not an item is supported. Earlier today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/releases/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/&quot;&gt;Envato implemented&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;Item Support Policy&lt;/a&gt; for sellers on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When browsing items on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, a blue badge indicates the seller provides support. There&amp;#8217;s also a badge and text that informs potential buyers if an item is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47991&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png?resize=639%2C408&quot; alt=&quot;This Item is Supported&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This Item is Supported
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt;, buyers automatically receive six months of support from the date of purchase. If you need support for an entire year, you can buy an extension for a nominal upgrade fee. Envato takes 30% and gives 70% of the purchase to authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of a &lt;b&gt;6-month support extension&lt;/b&gt; for a &lt;b&gt;Regular License&lt;/b&gt; is calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37.5% of the item price (30% of the list price) when purchased at the same time as the license;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;62.5% of the item price (50% of the list price) when purchased during the support period; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87.5% of the item price (70% of the list price) when purchased after the support period has ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Freeman, product manager for Envato, says the changes provide a standardized definition of support, &amp;#8220;Buyers will know exactly what to expect from all purchases on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers who purchased supported items before the new policy went into effect have six months of free tech support starting on September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disgruntled Authors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.envato.com/t/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/3619&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; with over 165 responses, sellers discussed the pros and cons of the policy while some expressed anger. &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/user/jonathan01&quot;&gt;Jonathan Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr3ativ.com/&quot;&gt;Cr3ativ&lt;/a&gt;, who sells several items on ThemeForest, thinks the policy is not as good as alternatives offered outside of the marketplaces because of its confusing complexity for both authors and buyers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure why Envato chose this solution when we already have a well established support/upgrade system in place within most of the WordPress community where 12 months of support is included in the purchase and customers receive a 50% discount to continue receiving support and updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is a work in progress, &amp;#8220;We will be monitoring the impacts of this change very closely and will be tweaking, improving and enhancing the support tools over coming weeks and months,&amp;#8221; Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a buyer or seller on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, let us know what you think of the support policy in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Twenty Sixteen Now Available on GitHub and the WordPress Theme Directory</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47973</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/twenty-sixteen-now-available-on-github-and-the-wordpress-theme-directory</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen, the default theme scheduled to ship with WordPress 4.4, is available for download on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/&quot;&gt;WordPress theme directory&lt;/a&gt;. According &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/29/twenty-sixteen-is-now-on-github/&quot;&gt;to Tammie Lister&lt;/a&gt;, Twenty Sixteen will be developed as if it were a feature plugin and will merge into WordPress core later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development takes place on GitHub, changes will regularly sync up to the WordPress theme directory. By installing and activating Twenty Sixteen from the theme directory, users can easily update to new versions as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Twenty Sixteen has 23 issues and 27 pull requests on GitHub. Many of the issues such as, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/pull/23&quot;&gt;introducing automated Travis CI build testing into Twenty Sixteen,&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/labels/discussion&quot;&gt;up for discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the top half of the Tavern looks like with Twenty Sixteen activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47974&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=1025%2C563&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the content section looks like. Notice the block of code that displays instead of an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47976&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=881%2C648&quot; alt=&quot;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen Activated
&lt;p&gt;Testers are encouraged to open issues and pull requests on GitHub. If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with how GitHub works, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; explains how to contribute to the Twenty Sixteen project. Keep in mind that Twenty Sixteen is a work in progress and should not be used in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Great jazz cover of one of my favorite Kendrick Lamar songs, Rigamortis, which of course is inspired by the great jazz song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=27&amp;v=TstRwZygLAo&quot;&gt;The Thorn by Willie Jones III&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress.com Unveils the Action Bar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47954</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-unveils-the-action-bar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/new-action-bar/&quot;&gt;unveiled a new user interface&lt;/a&gt; called the Action Bar. It&amp;#8217;s a bar that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen for logged in users and is accessible from any device. The bar performs multiple tasks depending on the page you&amp;#8217;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47955&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png?resize=1025%2C627&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Action Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress Action Bar
&lt;p&gt;When on a WordPress.com powered site that you&amp;#8217;re not following, the bar turns into a Follow button. Clicking the follow button will notify you of new posts published on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47956&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png?resize=192%2C60&quot; alt=&quot;Action Bar Follow Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Action Bar Follow Button
&lt;p&gt;If you click the three dots to the right, you&amp;#8217;ll see a variety of options depending upon the page you&amp;#8217;re viewing. If it&amp;#8217;s the homepage, you&amp;#8217;ll see links to download the theme the site uses, report the content, or manage the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re browsing a specific post on a WordPress.com site, you&amp;#8217;ll see an additional link to copy a shortlink for quick and easy sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47957&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png?resize=265%2C319&quot; alt=&quot;Easily Share Posts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easily Share Posts
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com and are logged in, the Follow button turns into a Customize button. This link provides a quick way to enter the Customizer. There&amp;#8217;s also an Edit link if you&amp;#8217;re browsing a published post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47958&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png?resize=307%2C348&quot; alt=&quot;Edit and Customize Links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Edit and Customize Links
&lt;p&gt;If the action bar is too big and you want to minimize it, click the three dots and select the option to Collapse the bar. It will shrink the bar into squares and get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the action bar is the ability to quickly see and download a theme used on a WordPress.com site. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for WordPress.com specific sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailypost.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The Daily Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What annoys me about the action bar is that it disappears when I scroll down. I caught myself scrolling down to read a post and when I looked for the edit button to fix a typo, the action bar was gone. I think it should stay on the screen at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to see the Edit link in the action bar open a front-end editor. It&amp;#8217;s time WordPress.com step up its game and stop forcing users through a backend interface to edit published content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the experimental action bar but at the same time, I question the reasoning for adding yet another user interface element to mimic actions already supported by other buttons and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, between the admin bar, dashboard, the edit link underneath a post, and the action bar, there are now four different ways to edit a post. How many roads are necessary to reach the same destination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com, let me know what you think of the action bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.3.3 Patches Security Vulnerabilities in BuddyPress Messages Component</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47948</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-3-patches-security-vulnerabilities-in-buddypress-messages-component</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-41978&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=828%2C265&quot; alt=&quot;BuddyPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3&lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2015/08/buddypress-2-3-3/&quot;&gt; is available&lt;/a&gt; and users are encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;update as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. A few security vulnerabilities were discovered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/buddypress-components-and-features/#internal-messaging&quot;&gt;BuddyPress Messages, &lt;/a&gt;a core component that allows users to send and receive private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to the BuddyPress team that could allow members to manipulate a failed private outbound message and inject unexpected output to the browser. The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof Katowicz-Kowalewski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the first vulnerability, the BuddyPress core development team independently discovered and fixed related vulnerabilities with the messages component that could allow for carefully crafted private message content to be rendered incorrectly to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3 also fixes a couple of bugs in the 2.3 codebase and improves support for backend changes made in WordPress 4.3. To protect your sites from these vulnerabilities, you should perform a full backup and &lt;strong&gt;update BuddyPress as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Theme Review Team Begins Phasing Out Favicon Support</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47940</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-begins-phasing-out-favicon-support</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main features in WordPress 4.3 are Site Icons. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icon&lt;/a&gt; is an image that represents a website across multiple platforms and replaces Favicons. With Site Icons in WordPress core, the WordPress Theme Review team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;phasing out the feature&lt;/a&gt; in existing themes hosted in the theme directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;p&gt;Justin Tadlock, a theme review admin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;published a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to provide a backwards compatible experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tadlock, the easiest method is to check if the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; function exists. This tells you if the user is running WordPress 4.3 and has the site icon feature available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check if the user has set up a new icon using the core WordPress feature by using the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; conditional tag which returns either &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some example code from the tutorial you can use to handle the check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ( ! function_exists( 'has_site_icon' ) || ! has_site_icon() ) {

    // Output old, custom favicon feature.
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional information, I encourage you to read&lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/wordpress/development/backwards-compatibility-site-icons/&quot;&gt; Stephen Cronin&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; which goes into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Theme Review Team enforces a guideline where features added to core are phased out of themes within two major releases. By the time WordPress 4.5 is released, theme authors will be able to remove legacy code without disrupting the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A survey or application form will soon be published which will result in a pool from which the attendees will be invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit is a rare opportunity for members of various contributor teams to focus and work together in the same physical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual WordPress Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use, build, or make a living with WordPress, please take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2015&quot;&gt;annual survey&lt;/a&gt;. Results will be shared during Matt Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation at WordCamp US. The more people who fill out the survey, the more representative the data will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation from 2014 to see results from the previous survey.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Stream Is Shutting Down Its Cloud Data Storage October 1st</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47925</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/stream-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-data-storage-october-1st</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/introducing-stream-3/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt; and includes some significant improvements. Stream is a WordPress plugin that tracks changes to a site similar to an audit trail. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service&quot;&gt;version two was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, it morphed from a plugin to a service. Activity logs were stored in the cloud which lessened the amount of resources used on local webservers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version three will no longer store data in the cloud. Instead, it will store activity logs locally. The cloud service provided by Stream 2 is closing on &lt;strong&gt;October 1st&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives users a little more than a month to migrate data from the cloud to their local webserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cloud is Expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Carbis, lead developer of Stream, says the time frame was chosen based on a number of factors, &amp;#8220;We chose a 6 week migration window as a balance between bleeding cash and doing the right thing by our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s also helpful to remember that the vast majority of our users are on a Free plan, which only includes 12 weeks of storage. We are monitoring the accounts of each of our paid users and I&amp;#8217;m personally making sure that every one of them has migrated,&amp;#8221; Carbis told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move away from the cloud is largely based on cost. The majority of Stream&amp;#8217;s customers signed up to the free plan with a significant lack of interest in the Pro Subscription. Server costs were also higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XWP to The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lack of income from Stream 2 and acquisition talks failing, Carbis was contracted to do outside work leaving Frankie Jarrett the only person working on the project. Stream&amp;#8217;s investor decided to pull the plug on the project at the same time Jarrett decided to resign from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I heard that Frankie had resigned I gave him a call. We reminisced on our achievements, and threw around some of our ideas on what could have been. That conversation renewed my inspiration. I jotted down some notes, and that’s when things started to turn around,&amp;#8221; Carbis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members from &lt;a href=&quot;https://xwp.co/&quot;&gt;XWP&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to lend a helping hand and the project is now officially under the XWP umbrella. This allows Stream to remain free and open source. The partnership will also facilitate add-on, connectors, and adapters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New in Stream 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is rewritten from the ground up. Activity logs use half the space in the database compared to Stream 2. It supports multisite through the use of Network Admin and uses a dependency injection model to be more extendable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Stream 3 includes a variety of improvements two notable features have been removed, Notifications and Reports. If you depend on these features, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/stream-3-faq/&quot;&gt;review the following FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbis and XWP are taking Stream into a new direction. Stream&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wp-stream/roadmap/&quot;&gt;proposed roadmap&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub and Carbis encourages users to not only review it, but to contribute to the project&amp;#8217;s future, &amp;#8220;I’d like to see Stream’s users contribute more to its direction. Contribution isn’t limited to ideas either. If you can design, develop, or translate, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wp-stream/stream&quot;&gt;contributing to the Stream project&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if Stream can regain the momentum it lost after transitioning to a cloud based system to store data. Now that Stream stores activity logs locally again, those in the EU should be able to use it without breaking privacy laws. Stream is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; on the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Akismet: Quantifying Reddit Bigotry</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1859</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/08/27/quantifying-reddit-bigotry/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2015-08-30): It looks like the team who created the tool decided to retire it due to some reported accuracy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never pass on the opportunity to mix in a little bit of humor with our passion for web content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our engineers, Dan Walmsley, participated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedyhackday.org/la-2015&quot;&gt;Cultivated Wit&amp;#8217;s Comedy Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles last weekend, and his team&amp;#8217;s resulting project has since surfaced on &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-tool-quantifies-reddit-bigotry&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/26/reddit-bigotry-check/&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeredditcheck.com/&quot;&gt;Free Reddit Check&lt;/a&gt;, created by Dan&amp;#8217;s team and crowned with the day&amp;#8217;s top prize, is a site which attempts to quantify the terribleness of Reddit users based on their public comment content and subreddit participation. While perfectly suited for a hack day which pairs developers and comedians, there is certainly usefulness in determining the respectability of a potential online acquaintance. Or just knowing who to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being obsessed with content analysis, community moderation, and keeping the web&amp;#8217;s underbelly in check, we can&amp;#8217;t help but think it&amp;#8217;s a nifty idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1859&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 205 – Interview With Miriam Schwab</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47915</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-205-interview-with-miriam-schwab</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode of WordPress Weekly, I&amp;#8217;m joined by Miriam Schwab, founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://illuminea.com/&quot;&gt;Illuminea&lt;/a&gt;, a web development company based in Israel. She’s also on the Steering Board of &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitaleveisrael.com/&quot;&gt;Digital Eve Israel&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leading communities for professional women in Israel to help empower women economically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab explains her WordPress origin story, what it&amp;#8217;s like to live in Israel, and how active the WordPress community is in her area. She shares her thoughts on the future of WordPress and warns that if it doesn&amp;#8217;t improve the user experience, it will drive users away to competing platforms. At the end of the interview, she tells us her favorite plugins that she installs on most of her client sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stories Discussed:&lt;/h2&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: First Look at the Twenty Sixteen Default WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47897</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.4 is the last scheduled major release of the year and with it will come a new default theme to replace Twenty Fifteen. On the Make WordPress Core site, Tammie Lister &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/25/introducing-twenty-sixteen/&quot;&gt;published an image gallery&lt;/a&gt; that shows off the design of Twenty Sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lister, the process of determining the new default theme has taken months, &amp;#8220;Lots of themes were considered, eventually settling on the one you see below. It’s a perfect fit,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47898&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png?resize=433%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen
&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen is designed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi&quot;&gt;Takashi Irie,&lt;/a&gt; who also designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2013/12/13/twenty-fourteen-wordpress-3-8-parker/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fourteen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2015/03/19/twenty-fifteen-the-wordpress-default-theme-for-2015/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; default themes. Irie describes Twenty Sixteen as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modernized approach of an ever-popular layout — a horizontal masthead and an optional right sidebar that works well with both blogs and websites. It has custom color options that allow you to make your own Twenty Sixteen. The theme was designed on a harmonious fluid grid with a mobile first approach. This means it looks great on any device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theme has hints of Twenty Fourteen but is different enough to stand on its own as a unique design. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look as modern as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; out-of-the box but the design could change during the 4.4 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help Twenty Sixteen be the best it can be, please join the weekly meetings held every Monday and Friday at 16:00 UTC in the #core-themes channel on &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt;. The meetings are a half hour-long and start once the theme is initially added to WordPress core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think of Twenty Sixteen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: OSTraining Makes Pods Framework Video Training Series Available for Free</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47885</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/ostraining-makes-pods-framework-video-training-series-available-for-free</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-40653&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg?resize=628%2C290&quot; alt=&quot;pods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/&quot;&gt;OSTraining&lt;/a&gt;, a site that offers video training for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and other technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/blog/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;http://pods.io/&quot;&gt;Pods Framework&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;training series&lt;/a&gt; is now available for free. Steve Burge, founder of OSTraining.com, says offering the video series for free is the result of a partnership with the Pods Framework project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This project came about because the OSTraining and Pods teams bumped into each other on a regular basis. I often ran into Jim True and Josh Pollock from Pods. We met at WordCamps and WordPress meetups in Tampa, Orlando, and Miami, FL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Pods team explained that they were working on improving their documentation. They started a YouTube series, wrote tutorials, and started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/pods-lead-developer-scott-kingsley-clark-launches-friends-of-pods-funding-campaign&quot;&gt;Friends of Pods&lt;/a&gt; initiative to support their efforts. Making the videos free is our way of contributing to the Pods project,&amp;#8221; Burge told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burge recorded the series after using Pods to create the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appalachiantrail.com/&quot;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt; website. The series provides an introduction to Pods, templates, creating a custom taxonomy, and more. Those interested can view the series on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;OSTraining.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk9dCVMQRmSptuJ6YdVzMkr5&amp;v=4rm95kNxRXg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a look at the first video in the series which introduces viewers to the Pods Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was created in 2014, the series contains great insight into the project and provides an educational foundation for learning Pods 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Request: Alex King Rememberances</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=22017</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear WordPress community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apologies for the selfish and personal nature of this post. I hope you will forgive me given the circumstances. As most of you know, I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as &amp;#8220;dad&amp;#8221;, but when she gets older she&amp;#8217;ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent more than a decade in the WordPress community and I&amp;#8217;d like to request that you to share a few thoughts or remembrances about me that we can compile and share with her when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have crossed paths or if I have managed to do something that you found helpful, I&amp;#8217;d love it if you would take a few minutes to write it down and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/contact&quot;&gt;send it to me&lt;/a&gt; or my wife: heatherkingcom@gmail.com. If you&amp;#8217;re willing to have the story shared publicly, please indicate that accordingly. By default, we will keep everything confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the thread: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; an ongoing story on this site. View the thread timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Step Up Your Game: How to Work With Successful WordPress Clients</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47868</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/step-up-your-game-how-to-work-with-successful-wordpress-clients</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47869&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Mario Y. Peshev&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Ryan Hellyer&quot; href=&quot;http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mario Peshev&lt;/a&gt;. Mario is the founder and WordPress Architect at &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/p9TnMSFMi2&quot;&gt;DevriX&lt;/a&gt; building and maintaining large WordPress-driven platforms. With over 10,000 hours of consulting and training, Mario&amp;#8217;s Yin and Yang is his Open Source advocacy and business growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning &amp;#8211; Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47879&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png?resize=682%2C281&quot; alt=&quot;Step up your game featured image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58522126@N00/430932479&quot;&gt;Stairwell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a learnaholic for as long as I can remember and when I read the aforementioned quote, it resonates strongly with me. My prelude to WordPress years ago was one of the steps toward improvement and success and I’ve developed a special love-hate relationship with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utmost admiration about its influence over the world in terms of Open Source and opportunities for various people in different niches, and its plague of being diminished and depreciated by professional developers and successful businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to solve these issues as long as the inner circle works towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are happy building lego type websites with random ThemeForest themes and you see that as your future, this post is not for you. If you love doing the same repeatedly for mom and pop shops, this may not resonate with you. This is applicable to people who want to get better at what they do, be more professional, and make some impact by solving complex problems for larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress For a Better Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, I presented at a conference focused on kids and teenagers to motivate them, prepare them for the adult life, and nurture their creativity. Kids these days hardly think about their future, between their teenage emotional dramas and boring homework assignments. If you think about it, how can they be passionate about becoming someone if they have no real idea what they need to know and do on a daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used WordPress as an example of a platform that children can use, one that provides them with the opportunity to develop a talent or passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using WordPress for homework and general notes (or a diary) could indicate interest in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young bloggers can potentially do creative writing or copywriting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly switching themes and playing with colors might open the room to design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding plugins and trying to implement complex combinations is the first step to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing posts, looking at analytics and comparing different titles or photos is the way to marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other potential areas of course, but as long as kids can associate with an activity, become passionate about it, and start digging into it, they can save years of slacking, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars on college degrees for specialties they couldn’t care less about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why more and more people join the WordPress industry and switch boring jobs in order to make a living off of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Types Of WordPress Services Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of opportunities for WordPress work is incredible but the vast pool of WordPress jobs is so vague and blurry, that hiring and educating talent is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep an eye on dozens of job boards, portals, and freelance networks. Clients look for Virtual Assistants to get their websites built. They look for expert WordPress developers to apply content changes to their site or web designers to develop complex plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis I see references to WordPress administrators, programmers, developers, designers, marketers, digital artists, webmasters, VAs, and plenty of other job titles used improperly. As a matter of fact, I’m now fascinated when I see a WordPress related job post or an offer looking for the right type of candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news is that you can do anything with WordPress. The caveat here is that WordPress itself is not a skill. You don’t ask for an Internet expert nowadays and you don’t go to the same doctor when you have a headache or you’ve injured your leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide industry of innocent clients and amateur service providers have made it nearly impossible to tell a developer from a marketer, or from a general user who has installed WordPress with an auto-installer twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Indecent World of WordPress Experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-39089&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Job Titles Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/5565517971&quot;&gt;I love &amp;#8217;84&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a lot about impostor syndrome in several reputable WordPress blogs, and people keep identifying themselves in the comments. In my opinion, this is a problem so insignificant as compared to the ever-growing pool of people claiming to be WordPress Experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last several years, I’ve interacted with people all around the world working with WordPress. From freelancers to successful business owners at conferences, and from beginner virtual assistants to full-stack consultants in social media, blogs and job networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of service providers that I’ve found is the one of &lt;em&gt;WordPress experts&lt;/em&gt;. You can easily substitute expert with specialist, guru, master, ninja and rockstar. Just open a new tab and do a few quick searches in Google, job networks, social media and view the large number of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list are &lt;em&gt;WordPress developers&lt;/em&gt;. A WordPress developer is often described as people who install plugins. There are various possible scenarios, but this is rarely the definition of an actual developer proficient in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some boards or blogs list specific skills that let you filter by programming language or a separate tool. My latest research with 200 contractors with WordPress developer titles led to 170 people who rate themselves with 4 or 5 out of 5 stars in PHP proficiency, and 30 with 3 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 170 people in the first group, 150 were college students, Internet marketers, VAs, and people who have substituted strings in WordPress themes thanks to support forums or help from the Codex. Not a single line of code was written from scratch, let alone building anything, and 4 out of 5 or higher self-assessed their level of PHP experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom McFarlin &lt;a href=&quot;http://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-developers-programmer-implementer/&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the difference between a developer and implementer and I wrote an overview defining &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-job-titles-dont-mean-much-anymore&quot;&gt;various technical skills in the WordPress context&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the lack of proper training, any official educational resource or meaningful set of skills per role, both finding talent and improving one’s skills is being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge you to interview several successful clients around you who looked for skillful WordPress folks. They either happened to know the right people, were recommended someone, ended up with several freelancers who messed up big time, went AWOL and suddenly took the cash and disappeared, couldn’t deliver, or they did and the site is incredibly slow and/or got hacked soon thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s sending serious businesses away and I won’t touch the topic of under pricing services and products which brings the quality and support way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivates people to use a reliable resource in order to grow? The WordPress Foundation, nor any of the big players provide official training curriculum, and a definition for formal roles. There is no WordPress certification program (I won’t get into that to avoid unnecessary discussions), and there are no clear paths for requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WordPress Community is Filled with Amateurs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, our community is a large group mostly composed of amateurs who started using WordPress one way or another. These people started earning money and reached a point where they don’t know where they stand, what they’re proficient in, if they’re doing fine, whether they’re experts, impostors, or somewhere in the middle, and what would be helpful to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still use FTP and work with PHP 5.2-supported hosts. The most popular theme marketplaces provide products with broken and inconsistent code. The WordPress.org plugin repository accepts plenty of plugins with suspicious consistency and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these issues are recognized publicly in the WordPress community. Some hosts prohibit SSH and allow solely FTP. PHP 5.2 will be supported by Core for a while, which doesn’t motivate hosts to upgrade. Marketplaces earn millions from their top sellers, so they’re not interested in quickly bringing up quality as long as poorly coded themes sell well. There’s also no formal constantly reviewed plugin repository for high quality plugins and no one is actively backing this idea up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the last paragraph as a rant, it’s because it is. It’s meant to be a “wake up call” to clients who don’t know better and service providers who want to become better. While the WordPress Core itself is incredibly stable and flexible, the rest of the infrastructure is mostly poorly coded due to under pricing, lack of skills, and lack of more successful clients interested in backing up WordPress teams and consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of people and plenty of applications of WordPress. Whatever you do, it’s your professional duty to offer the right type of service instead of misleading your clients, and be aware of the other pertinent verticals. Moreover, it’s the only way forward working with reputable organizations and large profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a Successful Client?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-32204&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png?resize=636%2C278&quot; alt=&quot;Success Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeveeaar/2035597695/&quot;&gt;seeveeaar&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige Conference&lt;/a&gt; happened a few weeks ago, and Shane Pearlman from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tri.be/&quot;&gt;Modern Tribe&lt;/a&gt; shared his experience in a presentation entitled, Land the Big Fish: Strategies Acquiring Larger Clients. It’s a motivational talk that outlines different strategies on negotiating and landing larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the session, Pearlman is asked, “What’s in it for me to go through all of that headache to procure bigger brand names?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated at the beginning, working with successful clients is not for everyone. Some people are afraid to leave their comfort zone. Others are too lazy to learn new skills or sometimes doing the same thing repeatedly may be their perfect job. For every other entrepreneur or business player, successful clients are exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each small change is magnified when working with successful clients. Usually, they have a lot of employees, a solid budget for marketing and advertising, a lot of traffic, and various complex requirements that help them attract more leads or automate their processes. T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hey are often respectable and have access to more capital. This allows them to invest more since their return of investment is worth it; while taking a risk due to saving a few bucks could very well ruin their reputation and harm their business. There are several examples of products or companies in the WordPress community that were hacked or where updates caused major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with successful clients is extremely rewarding and exciting, but getting there requires ace skills and solid experience, as well as the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Target Successful Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience with banks, telecoms, automotive, airline brands, large educational institutions and media outlets over the last 12 years as a developer and a technical lead, there are several specific areas where courageous WordPress freelancers and small business owners can focus on if they are aiming for growth and successful clients, but aren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have identified some steps for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/08/8-steps-to-move-from-freelancer-to-successful-company/&quot;&gt;moving from a freelancer to a successful company&lt;/a&gt;. Here is what we should focus on in the WordPress context in order to step up our game, understand our industry better, and start acting professionally if we want to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress is a Vague Term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a WordPress Expert says nothing. You may be a lead developer of WordPress or someone who can memorize the order of all submenus under Settings in the admin dashboard. Both are classified as WordPress experts and that’s what many people don’t realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialize in a given niche and polish your skills. Focus on a specific group of projects &amp;#8211; membership websites, eCommerce stores, multisite installs. Become a know-it-all professional for an extensible plugin such as, BuddyPress, Gravity Forms, or Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the value you are providing and what it corresponds to. Be respectful to the broad community of professionals in your area, learn from them, ask them to be your mentors. Even the best athletes and CEOs have coaches, business mentors, and boards of directors. Find out what it is that you do whether it’s design, development, marketing, or something else and learn the skill inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Installments Don’t Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people offer WordPress services as an add-on to their portfolio of other services without realizing the impact it has on the business. While WordPress is used for plenty of purposes, it’s still a technical platform that comes with its own specific set of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what will happen if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a vulnerable plugin that is exploited and your client’s password is stolen, along with their private details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You forget to protect the media uploader and the client uploads sensitive data. Scanned images of contracts and ID cards end up in the public space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your sitemap plugin indexes protected data since you used a plugin that doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a site and sell it to a client, and due to the terrible choice of plugins, the site crashes miserably and kills the server during a demonstration in front of their big clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a small list of what ifs, but they happen all the time. If you don’t possess the skills or offer the wrong service, this could damage your client’s business. Upping your game and providing solutions instead of websites allows you to take care of the infrastructure, maintenance work, support, development, security, marketing of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, be aware of the consequences and partner up with other agencies and consultants. Complete packages are what successful clients look for and inexperienced people often mess up what others have built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Expert Skills Won’t Cut It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients look for professional skills. They have real problems that can’t be solved with yet another plugin, and they are smart enough to know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the business of configuring themes and installing a few plugins for clients, that won’t do it for successful customers. You need to specialize in code, design, user experience, marketing, or something else that brings real value to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large clients are looking for state of the art designs, performant and secure code, brilliant marketing skills, and growth hacking strategy. Large clients are successful because they are outstanding at what they do, the services they offer, and they appreciate high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context-Specific WordPress Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations take their marketing presence and technical stack seriously. They carefully delegate based on multiple factors. Being in a meeting with a large client typically means discussing a use case together with several people such as, a creative director, VP of marketing, network engineer, and project manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being skillful in your niche and ready to provide value, you have to learn the business processes of your target client. Your idea of a solution may be applicable for small sites, but it may very well be a bad fit based on the company policy or the variety of services used by the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, a creative director may require you to prepare your theme to be ADA Section 508 compliant, which is an accessibility standard required by certain organizations. The VP of marketing may ask for a Hubspot integration with Cvent within your website for proper CRM and meeting request management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network engineer could outline that they need to host the solution on-site, and set up a specific set of web application firewalls and internal web server security rules restricting certain process callbacks. The project manager might share a complicated timeline based on the organization load, holiday schedule, decision maker’s availability, conferences, and various deliverables that need to be presented by different people and other third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are things that we’ve been asked for over the past few months. If you are used to working with a specific host using Apache, prepare for writing documentation and shipping to a restricted server running HHVM. If you use a framework that isn’t accessible, you will need to step back, explore the Section 508 standards, and build something compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic solutions are often not the right fit for large clients. But if you’re determined to learn more and become a better professional, that’s the perfect challenge for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solving More Complex Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to adjust to different environments, working with large clients means solving more complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a mom and pop shop is somewhat broken or down, it’s probably not a big deal if their site receives 100 visits per month. But for a project with tens of millions of views a month and thousands of concurrent users, it is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on larger and heavy platforms often means dealing with a lot of data, complex relationships, and solid traffic. This means that every single line of your code and business decision will inevitably impact the entire system in a way visible to hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to cope with these, you should study your specialty in detail and understand what the impact is of every single change. These skills increase your value and let you face similar challenges and solve problems that the majority of beginners can’t even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn a lot about the entire stack, and get to know hundreds of different rules. At some point you will voluntarily violate those rules, being aware of the fact that some design patterns and best practices don’t solve specific problems. It’s better to denormalize a database or minify a compression algorithm in order to solve a business problem for a large platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just as they say at a music college &amp;#8211; you learn the music theory for three years, and then you throw everything away and start playing jazz. You need to know the entire architecture and strategy first in order to decide how to optimize it in the best possible manner, whether it’s using a best practice or violating one for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaming Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have worked solo or in a small team, you will eventually need to partner up or grow. Either way, large projects are time consuming and require different expertise, and it’s unthinkable for one to know it all. Therefore, you will work with other professionals from more industries, team up and solve more complex problems together, and learn more about their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have thought about mastering a single skill, teaming up with the right people will add a few more skills as an extra perk, which will increase the potential of your main skill as well. Working with financial analysts on a project for a bank helped me to understand the entire model of loans and mortgages, as well as the internal banking policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to learn how loans and interests work in different cases and get acquainted with standardized security regulations at companies in the financial field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-44224&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png?resize=688%2C368&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Security Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/8264582@N06/3383392046&quot;&gt;Two Locks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy and security are important topics that people often misjudge. Working with large clients means more responsibility and higher impact in case of a problem. In the process of building a solution or consulting a reputable organization, you will most likely have to comply with various security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of them may seem unnecessary, there is a reason they exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better it is for you, your clients, and future endeavors. If you’re not using VPNs, SSH keys, two-factor authentication, or voice recognition IDS, this may be a good lesson for you. Why are they needed, what problems do they solve, and how can you apply them to your personal data and existing set of clients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization and Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47877&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg?resize=620%2C400&quot; alt=&quot;BrainyQuote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BrainyQuote
&lt;p&gt;In order to be helpful to large businesses as a consultant, or an agency, you need to be reliable. This may be a result of a number of testimonials, successful track record at previous companies or a good portfolio. It’s always challenging to start with large customers, so improving your skills and working hard in order to become valuable is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being organized and process-oriented is essential to most reputable organizations. The majority of them are more conservative and operate slowly, since a minor mistake could cost them millions or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rely on detailed specifications, scope of work documents, use case diagrams, UX mockups/wireframes, E/R diagrams, and a large list of documents. They include every single detail in their planning &amp;#8211; from holidays for each member of their team, to different dependencies from other service providers and third-party members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients have managed to build a process and scale it in a way that grows their revenue in a predictable way. In order to be able to handle large projects, you need to treat them as a small project that takes longer to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use a project management system and version control properly, define your pricing strategy, make sure to predict all of the delays for both communication and payments. Learn how large organizations operate and do your due diligence upfront in order to avoid surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take anything for granted and don’t assume anything. The more confident you are, the higher the possibility of making a major mistake. There are always new automatic deployment strategies or a DevOps service you haven’t heard of, another massive CSS3 grid, or a growth hacking strategy that you haven’t explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more challenges you face, the more you’ll learn, and be able to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Personal WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=21662</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/22/personal-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve forked the FavePersonal theme to release a few changes that I&amp;#8217;ve made to it for my own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improved Gallery feature, including support for WordPress shortcode galleries. If you&amp;#8217;re uploading photos directly to your gallery post, you can use drag and drop to set the order for them now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Post Formats admin UI is now responsive and works great on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the Social plugin from the theme (requested by WP.org) &amp;#8211; it can still be installed separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make tons of misc. code changes to match new coding standards vs. previous coding standards (and pass the theme check).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/maine-gallery-510x469.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gallery&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-22028&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally hoping to have the modified theme hosted on WordPress.org but after weeks of waiting for review, they responded that features of the theme like &lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24520#comment:4&quot;&gt;choosing colors and post formats&lt;/a&gt; should be done in separate plugins instead. This makes no sense to me as these are core features of the theme, but happily there are great places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that will host the project for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Personal theme is quite assuredly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?url=alexking.org&quot;&gt;mobile-friendly&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it a great fit for the importance Google&amp;#8217;s is placing on mobile-friendly sites lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub or, for you technically minded, grab the reop with git. Just make sure to also grab the submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:alexkingorg/wp-personal.git&lt;br /&gt;
cd wp-personal&lt;br /&gt;
git submodule update --init --recursive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/project/personal&quot;&gt;Personal Theme&lt;/a&gt;. View the project timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.3.1 also fixes twenty-six bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.3.1">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.3/?rev=34199&amp;stop_rev=33647">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.3.1</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.3.1.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard.

<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.4">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33573&amp;stop_rev=33396">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.4</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.4.</p>
<p><em>Already testing WordPress 4.3? The second release candidate is now available (<a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-RC2.zip">zip</a>) and it contains these fixes.

<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version.

<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.3.1 also fixes twenty-six bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.3.1">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.3/?rev=34199&amp;stop_rev=33647">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.3.1</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.3.1.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard.

<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.4">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33573&amp;stop_rev=33396">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.4</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.4.</p>
<p><em>Already testing WordPress 4.3? The second release candidate is now available (<a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-RC2.zip">zip</a>) and it contains these fixes.

<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version.

<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Site icons for all</em><br />

&lt;p&gt;This update clarifies the error messages that Akismet uses so that they&amp;#8217;re easier to understand, and it enables link previews in the admin for all links in a comment &amp;#8212; not just the author&amp;#8217;s website link. A fix is also included for a bug that could have caused comment moderation emails to be sent for some comments that were caught as spam.  For a full list of the changes in this release, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/akismet/trunk&quot;&gt;revision log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions. If you need to download the plugin zip file directly, links to all versions are available in &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the WordPress plugins directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1873&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WP Comment Humility Relocates the Comments Top-level Menu Item to the Posts Menu</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48313</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-comment-humility-relocates-the-comments-top-level-menu-item-to-the-posts-menu</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-billie-named-after-jazz-singer-billie-holiday-is-available-for-download&quot;&gt;features in WordPress 4.3&lt;/a&gt; is that comments on pages are disabled by default. If you only enable comments for posts, you may be interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;WP Comment Humility&lt;/a&gt;, a new plugin created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;John James Jacoby&lt;/a&gt; that moves the top-level Comments menu item to the Posts menu. The following screenshot better illustrates what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48314&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png?resize=429%2C378&quot; alt=&quot;Comment Humility in Action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Comment Humility in Action
&lt;p&gt;If a site enables comments for posts only, this location for the menu item makes sense. What if you&amp;#8217;re using Custom Post Types? According the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/faq/&quot;&gt;plugin&amp;#8217;s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, the user experience might be weird, &amp;#8220;If you have a post type other than &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; that supports comments, it may make more sense to not use this plugin,&amp;#8221; Jacoby said. He suggests giving it a try and if the user experience doesn&amp;#8217;t feel right, to disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/stuttter/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;located on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; where you can also submit Pull Requests. WP Comment Humility works out-of-the-box without any configuration options on WordPress 4.3 and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; in the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Highlights From Matt Mullenweg’s Q&amp;A Session on Product Hunt</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48303</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/highlights-from-matt-mullenwegs-qa-session-on-product-hunt</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;On September 22nd, Matt Mullenweg participated in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;question and answer session&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. Product Hunt is a site &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;that lets users share and discover new products. In the session, Mullenweg answers questions like what advice he&amp;#8217;d give to his 20 and 25-year-old self and how he combats burn out. Here are a few highlights from the session.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nikhil V&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Hello Matt, with the upcoming release of the WP REST API in WordPress core, what do you hope to most see built with its capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m hugely excited about the REST API! Once the infrastructure is in, I think we&amp;#8217;ll see really widespread adoption from plugins that right now are creating their endpoints in very ad-hoc ways. Once we iterate a bit more on the core content endpoints and authentication I think we&amp;#8217;ll see a lot more specialized interfaces built on WP as like a content kernel, an engine powering a wide array of applications and interfaces you&amp;#8217;d never imagine having WordPress behind them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erik Torenberg &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;If you could go back in time and give advice for your, say, 20-year-old self, what would you tell yourself? How about 25?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; To my 20-year-old self I would say to be okay with things building up over time. Something I didn&amp;#8217;t appreciate until recently is that there any many productive decades ahead with which to build the things that I feel need to exist in the world. One of the best things I did then was avoid any press or capitalization on my age (to the extent I could) because youth is an ephemeral asset and just a novelty in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my 25-year-old self I would tell him to slow down and think about health more, I burned the candle at both ends that year. I would also say to not get as caught up in mailing list and IRC arguments and discussions, just focus on building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sydney Liu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In the early days of WordPress, what was the 20% that got you the 80% of the results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; There&amp;#8217;s no simple answer there, if I had to pick one thing it would be &lt;em&gt;luck&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Kristof Bernaert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; How do you see WP about 5 years, or how do you want it to see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In 5 years I think that WP will be infinitely easier to use for both power-users, developers, and newbies. You will be able to have a full experience of core, plugins, themes, docs, and support in several dozen languages that will be as large or larger than English. There will be over a million people making their living on top of the platform. Most people will be creating from touch devices, and their content will mostly not come from keyboards (virtual or physical) as an input device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Tys Bradford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;&amp;#8211; Your accomplishments with WordPress have literally changed the face of the internet and enabled people without programming skills to make beautiful and functional websites. Do you think this could be replicated ever with mobile applications (iOS/Android)? I have seen a few companies try, but none have come close to delivering in the way WordPress is able to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Thank you! The ecosystems and app stores for iOS and Android right now are too locked down, and the discoverability and overhead of apps is too distorted, for an approach like WordPress&amp;#8217; to work for mobile applications. The environment for the foreseeable future there is going to favor more centralized apps, my only hope is that at least a few get really successful (including ours) that aren&amp;#8217;t advertising-driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Question Was Not Answered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my question was not answered. However, I&amp;#8217;m going to ask it in this post with the hope that he&amp;#8217;ll answer it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve spent a lot of time, money, and energy trying to create a great mobile experience in WordPress via dedicated apps. As more of the WordPress backend becomes responsive, how will this affect (if any) the priority level of developing the mobile apps versus putting that time and effort into a 100% responsive WordPress backend?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullenweg answers a lot more questions than what&amp;#8217;s listed above but those are the ones that stand out to me. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;read the entire session&lt;/a&gt; on the Product Hunt site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress REST API Is One Major Step Closer to Being Merged Into Core</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48284</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-rest-api-is-one-major-step-closer-to-being-merged-into-core</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After more than three years of development, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://v2.wp-api.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress REST API&lt;/a&gt; is one major step closer to getting merged into core. Ryan McCue, a lead contributor to the project, published the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;official proposal&lt;/a&gt; to merge the API into WordPress. The proposal explains what the REST API is, why it&amp;#8217;s needed, an integration plan, and what happens after the merge. The plan is to integrate the API in two stages, infrastructure and endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Part Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure is the code responsible for routing requests and handling the meta layer of the API, including JSON serialization/deserialization, linking, embedding, and REST best practices. Merging the infrastructure first allows developers to start building upon it and to migrate from existing custom code. The plan is to merge the infrastructure portion of the API in WordPress 4.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endpoints are considered the more complex of the two as they’re responsible for mapping data from the external JSON format to the internal data structures and vice versa. In other words, endpoints are the bridges of communication between WordPress and external applications. To provide more time for core committers to review the code, endpoints will be merged in WordPress 4.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of the API &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API&quot;&gt;takes place on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; but core WordPress development takes place on Subversion and Trac. When the API is merged into core, it will no longer be developed as a separate project. McCue proposes that the best of GitHub and Trac be integrated so developers comfortable with GitHub can continue to contribute to the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the team’s experience with GitHub as well as Trac, we can bring the best of both worlds by helping integrate the two. This would also improve contributions to WordPress as a whole, and benefit the whole community. This will be especially important as we encourage more contributions from the wider community (client authors, for example). We think we can make good progress here, and we’d love to try to help improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress&quot;&gt;GitHub repository for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;s synced to its Subversion counterpart, it does not accept pull requests. If integrating GitHub and Trac proves to be successful, it could open the door for WordPress to accept pull requests or contributions through GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan to merge the API into core is not finalized and the team needs your &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;comments, questions, and opinions&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage you to read the full proposal and the comments as McCue answers additional questions related to the merge. How happy are you to see this merge proposal?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The Impacts HeroPress Is Having on WordPress Communities in India</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48286</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-impacts-heropress-is-having-on-wordpress-communities-in-india</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Topher DeRosia, who recently attended&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia&quot;&gt; WordCamp Pune&lt;/a&gt;, India, &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/subtle-impacts/&quot;&gt;published a post on the HeroPress blog&lt;/a&gt; that describes the subtle impacts the project is having on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saurabh Shukla, lead organizer for WordCamp Pune, says the site inspired not only their speaker selection but their presentations as well, &amp;#8220;We wanted people to derive at least a level of inspiration from the speakers and decided that stories make more sense than presentations,&amp;#8221; Shukla said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of inspiring presentations at WordCamp Pune include, a workshop where people could experience accessibility issues for themselves, WordPress for activism, and building education products for South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Presentation in a Classroom at WordCamp Pune
&lt;p&gt;According to DeRosia, many Indians feel like their WordPress communities are not getting the respect they deserve. DeRosia believes the amount of excitement expressed by Indians for HeroPress is because their work is noticed and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;That&lt;/em&gt; is why India is excited about HeroPress. They’re getting respect. Not just from me, but from thousands of readers around the world,&amp;#8221; DeRosia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although DeRosia says he&amp;#8217;d be content with the impacts the site has had if HeroPress ended today, I would be sad to see it go  because it&amp;#8217;s a great addition to the WordPress community. Thankfully, DeRosia says people are requesting more essays, exchanges of knowledge, shared wisdom, shared respect, and more of the HeroPress spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an essay published on HeroPress or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;project&amp;#8217;s mission&lt;/a&gt; has inspired you in any way, please let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Interview, and Complementing Slack</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45326</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/09/complementing-slack/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.me/tonyconrad&quot;&gt;Tony Conrad&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strictlyvc.com/&quot;&gt;StrictlyVC&lt;/a&gt; event in San Francisco last week, following a dizzyingly talented line-up of &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/chamath-palihapitaya-on-insane-burn-rates-ipos-and-raising-a-new-real-estate-fund/&quot;&gt;Chamath Palihapitiya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dfj.com/content/steve-jurvetson&quot;&gt;Steve Jurvetson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/18/move-over-slack-automattic-mulls-commercializing-its-own-internal-messaging-product/&quot;&gt;Techcrunch has a good write-up with a number of the relevant quotes from the event&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing I&amp;#8217;d like to respond to, because it wasn&amp;#8217;t a direct quote, is the headline &amp;#8220;Move Over Slack? Automattic Mulls Commercializing Its Own Internal Messaging Product.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem is the headline missed the obvious alliteration of &amp;#8220;Mullenweg Mulls,&amp;#8221; &lt;img src=&quot;http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f600.png&quot; alt=&quot;😀&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;but more importantly&amp;#8230; &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; has become a really key tool for both Automattic &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;and WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt; and anything we do with the evolution of &lt;a href=&quot;http://p2theme.com/&quot;&gt;P2&lt;/a&gt; (some of which we already have running internally) will be complementary to Slack, not competitive with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jeff Yablon and the WordPress Foundation Settle Out of Court</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48267</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jeff-yablon-and-the-wordpress-foundation-settle-out-of-court</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation sued Jeff Yablon&lt;/a&gt; for trademark infringement. The Foundation wanted Yablon to stop using its trademarks, dismiss the opposition proceeding, pay the foundation for any profits related to use of the WordPress trademarks, pay up to $100,000 per infringing domain name, transfer the domains and pay other fees and damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline of Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 22nd, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=7&quot;&gt;Yablon filed a request&lt;/a&gt; for default judgement. On June 29th, the Foundation responded to Yablon by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=8&quot;&gt;asking the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board&lt;/a&gt; to deny Yablon&amp;#8217;s request for default judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 9th, David Mermelstein, Administrative Trademark Judge, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=9&quot;&gt;filed a response&lt;/a&gt; that not only denied Yablon&amp;#8217;s motion for default judgment, but also suspended proceedings until the civil case was complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With proceedings suspended, Yablon could no longer file motions or requests with the TTAB. The only option left was to proceed through court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Settlement Between Yablon and The Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 21st, Yablon and the WordPress Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudup.com/cLmq3DWS6MZ&quot;&gt;settled out of court&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48277&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png?resize=839%2C621&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of Settlement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sample of Settlement
&lt;h3&gt;Yablon&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the settlement, by no later than October 15th, Yablon agrees to cease any and all use of the WordPress name, logos, trademarks, and any other name or mark confusingly similar to the term WordPress or its logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also has to cease any and all use of the WordPress Marks, standing alone or in combination with other words or designs, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use in any company name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta-tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personalized URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyword Advertising on Yablon&amp;#8217;s websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media handles or account names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indoor outdoor store signage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letterhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stationary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon must also comply with the terms of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/&quot;&gt;WordPress trademark and domain name policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No later than five days after the effective date (Oct 15th), Yablon has to transfer all of the domains he owns that incorporate the WordPress Mark to the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Yablon acknowledges that the Foundation owns and has the exclusive rights in and to the WordPress marks in connection with the goods and services identified in each of WordPress&amp;#8217; registrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon can no longer do anything inconsistent with the Foundation&amp;#8217;s ownership of its WordPress Marks and registrations thereof, including but not limited to, contesting the Foundation&amp;#8217;s title to or the validity of the WordPress marks or the trademark registrations thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WordPress Foundation&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Yablon transfers the domains to the Foundation and does not breach the terms of the agreement, the Foundation will redirect the domains to a domain of Yablon&amp;#8217;s choosing for 6 months from the effective date or April 1, 2016, whichever comes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 10 days of the domains being transferred, the Foundation will file a stipulated request to withdrawal its U.S. Opposition Proceeding No. 91221895 without prejudice and Case 3:15-cv02745 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, without prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as Yablon does not breach the agreement, the Foundation agrees not to sue for violating its trademarks prior to the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation will not object to Yablon&amp;#8217;s use of the WordPress Marks as part of any subdomains or subdirectories associated with any second level domain name registered to and controlled exclusively by Yablon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples include but are not limited to, wordpress.answerguy.com or answerguy.com/wordpress in connection with services that involve use of the WordPress platform, support the WordPress brand services, and that do not otherwise violate the rights of the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parties agree to bear their own attorney&amp;#8217;s fees and costs, if any were incurred through the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;spoke to Yablon&lt;/a&gt; on the phone in June shortly after the lawsuit was filed, he sounded like he knew what he was getting into and the complexities involved with U.S. Trademarks. Yablon strongly believed he had enough evidence to pursue the matter and to see it through the court system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing the court case all the way through, he chose to give up which in the court system, is not the same thing as losing, as losing or winning sets a precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Yablon didn&amp;#8217;t lose the case, the WordPress Foundation didn&amp;#8217;t win either. It&amp;#8217;s a reminder that the Foundation will aggressively defend its trademarks in the court system if other means prove unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think Yablon’s mission to defend his use of WordPress in a top-level domain name and potentially open the door for others to do the same, was in the best interest of the WordPress community as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: Gravity Flow makes custom form administrative workflows simple</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14337</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/gravity-flow-makes-custom-form-administrative-workflows-simple/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;Gravity Flow&lt;/a&gt; is one of the coolest new plugins I&amp;#8217;ve seen in quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoices, purchase orders, job applications, and employee vacation requests are just a few potential applications for Gravity Flow, which makes form-centric approval, user input, and notification processes simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With Gravity Flow, you use the power of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; to design your forms, and you use Gravity Flow to design your process using easy to use drag-and-drop tools,&amp;#8221; the video states. The flows created in Gravity Flow can be customized to include all sorts of user-defined paths to request stakeholder feedback, get administrative approval, or fire off a notification that a certain step in the flow has been accomplished. It can even be integrated with other notification systems like Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that common to see a WordPress plugin (especially an add-on plugin) that simultaneously targets a niche and serves it so extensively. Gravity Flow is built to extend the powerful Gravity Forms product, and it really takes it an extra mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of potential for Gravity Flow for intranets and other corporate environments with lots of stakeholders and traditionally clunky, email based workflows for approval of common tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trying Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took Gravity Flow for a spin, because there is a handy demo site capability built in. For a plugin this complex, being able to test drive it is a really great feature. Most workflow tasks can take place either in the admin or on the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating workflows feels a lot like adding regular notifications to Gravity Forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14340&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-workflow-752x579.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workflows have many configuration and sending options. And each step can be sorted and arranged to follow a series of steps, and can even allow for delays (like for a scholarship review period, in my example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s the view for an administrator, but someone who is responsible for providing feedback or approval has a front-end view to directly interact with the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14339&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-review-update-workflow-752x872.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-review-update-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;872&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And administrators can see reports of activity for various workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14338&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-reports-752x552.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-reports&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;552&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty simple overview of the plugin, and I&amp;#8217;d recommend you &lt;a href=&quot;http://demo.gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the demo&lt;/a&gt;, or his full &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.gravityflow.io/category/34-walkthroughs&quot;&gt;walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; examples. but this at least highlights some of the plugin&amp;#8217;s power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Development of Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting things about Gravity Flow is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Henty&lt;/a&gt; made it. Steven actually works at Rocketgenius, the company behind Gravity Forms, and he is a developer of the main Gravity Forms product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to Steven about why this isn&amp;#8217;t a Gravity Forms official add-on, and what it&amp;#8217;s like working on a side project for your own company&amp;#8217;s product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocketgenius has a lot of plans and loads of really exciting stuff in the pipeline so it was a question of priorities &amp;#8211; Rocketgenius can’t possibly do absolutely everything at the same time. For me it’s a project that’s niche enough to be an interesting and profitable side project and yet not too time-consuming so I can continue to focus 100% on my day job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterated how important it is to him that he had his team behind him for this project. And Carl Hancock &amp;#8212; co-founder of Rocketgenius &amp;#8212; is excited about Steven&amp;#8217;s product as well, saying &amp;#8220;The product is awesome. It&amp;#8217;s definitely more complex [and] business oriented, but that&amp;#8217;s a good thing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl also shared that Steve has a background that lends itself to thinking about complex problems to solve, working on, &amp;#8220;more enterprise stuff pre-WordPress, on a wide variety of platforms and programming languages.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve did a great job with Gravity Flow, and I&amp;#8217;m happy to see it out there.  On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/gravity-flow/&quot;&gt;his personal blog&lt;/a&gt;, he highlights use cases for the product, which are real world examples based on how his first 100 beta testers are using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gravity ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Rocketgenius employees have Gravity Forms focused side projects, which I think is really cool. Another favorite of mine is David Smith&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://gravitywiz.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Wiz&lt;/a&gt;, that adds functionality snippets, or &amp;#8220;perks&amp;#8221;, to Gravity Forms. The third-party ecosystem is doing well too; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityplus.pro/&quot;&gt;Gravity Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityview.co/&quot;&gt;Gravity View&lt;/a&gt; are two healthy Gravity Forms focused businesses that come to mind, and I&amp;#8217;m sure there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main plugin continues to dominate the WordPress forms space. Though it is commercial only, it powers hundreds of thousands of websites, and has dozens of official &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/&quot;&gt;add-ons&lt;/a&gt;. Carl has told me many times he doesn&amp;#8217;t even view most other WordPress forms plugins as competition (though newer entrants like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ninjaforms.com/&quot;&gt;Ninja Forms&lt;/a&gt; are doing quite well for themselves), as Gravity Forms aims to take marketshare away from complex hosted solutions like Wufoo, rather than gobble up the much larger but less demanding market that just wants simple contact forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up with Gravity Flow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the website&lt;/a&gt;. And the project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stevehenty/gravityflow&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt; as well, as Steve is billing for support and automatic upgrades, which starts at €87 (around $100) per year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems like the longest days are those in between an Apple announcement and when the products are actually available. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to iOS 9, WatchOS 2, 6s+, Apple TV&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Recap of WordCamp Pune, India, by Topher DeRosia</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48212</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48213&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; href=&quot;http://topher1kenobe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Topher DeRosia&lt;/a&gt;. Topher has contributed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe#content-plugins&quot;&gt;number of plugins&lt;/a&gt;, spoken at many WordCamps, and is the lead of documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://easydigitaldownloads.com/&quot;&gt;Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/a&gt; He also operates &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/&quot;&gt;HeroPress.com&lt;/a&gt; on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last July, the lead organizer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pune.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Pune, India &lt;/a&gt;asked if I would come and speak about HeroPress. This post isn&amp;#8217;t going to be about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;HeroPress&lt;/a&gt; nor about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/category/wordcamp/pune/&quot;&gt;my adventures on the trip&lt;/a&gt;. No, this post is going to be about a WordCamp in a relatively large city in India, how it compares to American WordCamps, and some things that were experimented with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Similarities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, WordCamp Pune is exactly like every other WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve been to. The night before the event, there was a speaker dinner with excellent food and wonderful company. Registration was chaotic because WiFi was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone was happy and excited to be there, and it was very loud because everyone wanted to be part of a conversation. It had all the elements I love about WordCamps; handshakes between new friends, hugs between old friends, and huge transfers of information between everyone, it was fantastic. Aside from WordCamp Miami, it&amp;#8217;s also the largest WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended with 500 tickets sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was well-organized, by which I mean things were well planned for, and handled well when they didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Sessions were held in university class rooms. I think they were a little small for the number of attendees, but it didn&amp;#8217;t detract from the experience. Here&amp;#8217;s an example of a room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s Ramya Pandyan talking about being a better blogger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended where the sessions were in a variety of languages. I would expect this in a place like WordCamp EU, but to have it be a variety of &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; languages was fascinating to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unofficial time zone of India is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/04/28/india-journal-understanding-ist-indian-stretchable-time/&quot;&gt;Indian Stretchable Time&lt;/a&gt;. On the first day of WordCamp, Saurabh worked hard to keep things on schedule. We started 30 minutes late, but on Foundation Day, things got started an hour late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was full of people sitting and waiting patiently, but starting on time was &lt;strong&gt;not expected&lt;/strong&gt;. In the US, I would have expected a lot more cranky people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things were heavily guarded. The main venue was quite open, but to get into Foundation Day, I had to let these guys check me with a magnetic wand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48219&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png?resize=904%2C510&quot; alt=&quot;Indian Policemen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then 20 feet away sign in at a guard house, and then 30 feet beyond that show my ID inside the front door of the venue. This kind of thing also happened at restaurants and every time I went into my hotel. No-one was ever aggressive or suspicious, it&amp;#8217;s just something that happened and everyone took it in stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Word Lounge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48220&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png?resize=298%2C462&quot; alt=&quot;Word Lounge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There was a room set aside to be an all day open session for writers. There&amp;#8217;s a local group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlphabetSambar&quot;&gt;Alphabet Sambar&lt;/a&gt; (Sambar is a soup) that has a regular meetup to help each other with writing. They made sure to welcome attendees and keep a good discussion going all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this idea of unconference rooms based on topic. Some people thrive on the group communication that can come from that format, and I&amp;#8217;d love to see other topical open forums at other WordCamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The After Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of quiet after parties, so I can talk to people. I can also appreciate people wanting a pretty intense party atmosphere. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/crccpune&quot;&gt;Classic Rock Coffee Co.&lt;/a&gt; offered both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had three large areas, the largest being almost 6000 sq. ft., one about 800 sq. ft., and an ampitheater with seating for about 100 where they had live classic rock bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was a closed in area with seating for about 40 people that felt more like a cafe or restaurant. The larger open areas had a full bar and restaurant. Except for the cafe, the whole place had a fabric roof which is less sturdy than canvas. It had an outdoors feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at a table of about 15 people and had no trouble communicating with any of them. I was probably 130 feet from the music and it was well contained. I was able to communicate without noise being an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of people sat at tables, in the cafe, in the ampitheater; wherever they were most comfortable. It was probably my favorite after-party venue of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bits and Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult thing for me was trying to discern people through their accents. Just about everyone had a solid handle on English, but there&amp;#8217;s a mental fatigue that comes from parsing the words through an accent. The longer you do it, the harder it gets, especially with sleep deprivation. I tried not to be rude, and people were patient with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a photo area with some crazy hats and people seemed to have a really good time with it. I can see it working at other WordCamps as well. The ladies from Hummingbird got one of me in a crazy hat, but I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48226&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png?resize=1025%2C578&quot; alt=&quot;Crazy Hat Picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was prepared on-site in realtime and it worked. It was mostly sandwiches, and the food prep people took a request, made the sandwich, and handed it to the person in moments. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have expected it to work that smoothly, but it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit and bottled water were available just about all the time, which was nice since it was pretty hot that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the food and language, this WordCamp didn&amp;#8217;t feel all that foreign to me. I suspect it&amp;#8217;s because WordCamps have a solid template for sessions, scheduling, etc. I enjoyed that, it enabled me to really take part in the event without having to stand to the side wondering what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers seemed to be on the ball and did a great job sharing the responsibilities, which I think is vital with a camp this size. The people were engaged, took full advantage of the options available to them, and &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; is what made it a successful WordCamp in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever get the chance to attend a WordCamp in a culture other than your own, I highly recommend you jump at the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Look Inside the Offices of 16 People Who Work With WordPress on a Daily Basis</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48204</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-look-inside-the-offices-of-16-people-who-work-with-wordpress-on-a-daily-basis</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a remote worker environment, people have the choice to work from home or wherever it&amp;#8217;s convenient. Syed Waseem Abbas published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://torquemag.io/inside-the-workplaces-of-16-wordpress-community-mavens/&quot;&gt;guest post on Torquemag,&lt;/a&gt; that looks at the offices of 16 people who work with WordPress on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the offices are classy while others are small. Many of the people featured in the post use one or more Apple products. If you&amp;#8217;re curious as to what my setup looks like, here you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48205&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg?resize=960%2C720&quot; alt=&quot;My Home Office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My Home Office
&lt;p&gt;Most of the work I do is on a Windows 7 Professional 64bit desktop PC with two 23-inch monitors. When I work remotely, I use a fully loaded 15-inch MacBook Pro with retina display from 2013. As a devoted Windows user, I feel like I&amp;#8217;m part of a dying breed, especially within the WordPress ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For WordPress Weekly, I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000PTF0E2&quot;&gt;Samson CO1U&lt;/a&gt; USB powered condenser microphone connected to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/musical-instruments/dp/B001D7UYBO/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442008126&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Rode+Swivel+mount&quot;&gt;Rode PSA1 swivel mount&lt;/a&gt; with a boom arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predominantly work in a sitting position which is why I&amp;#8217;m in the market for a standing desk where the height can be easily adjusted. I&amp;#8217;m also looking for a new office chair where the arm rests don&amp;#8217;t disintegrate within the first year of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions, let me know in the comments. Also, if you need inspiration to create the perfect office environment, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://officetoday.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Office Today&lt;/a&gt;. Office Today features remote offices and locations from across the world used by Automattic employees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: bbPress 2015 Survey Results Show Users Want Attachments, Better Moderation Tools</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48180</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/bbpress-2015-survey-results-show-users-want-attachments-better-moderation-tools</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The bbPress development team &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2015/09/2015-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;published the results&lt;/a&gt; of its 2015 survey. This year, 213 people participated which is 30 more &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2014/05/2014-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;than last year&lt;/a&gt;. After reviewing, replacing, and removing some questions from the 2014 survey, this year&amp;#8217;s survey has 25 questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of survey question types were used to gather the data including, multiple choices, check boxes, text fields, email box, and open‐ended questions. Empty forms were deleted and those marked as incomplete were reviewed individually. Submissions that had no responses on the second and third pages of the survey were excluded from the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highlights From the Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of respondents use bbPress 2.5 and above with WordPress 4.2 and above. Seventy-one percent of participants using bbPress &amp;lt;=1.x.x are also using the latest version of WordPress. This data indicates bbPress users are vigilant in keeping their sites up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of who uses bbPress, 51% of respondents use it on their own sites while 30% create sites with bbPress forums for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48182&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png?resize=485%2C249&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress 2015 Survey Users&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress 2015 Survey Who Uses bbPress
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, the top three languages used are English 74%, German 7%, and French 6.5%. Three-fourths or 75% of bbPress installations are within WordPress either in the domain root, physical directory, or physical subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining 25% are on multisite installations where more than half have activated bbPress network-wide and the rest in multiple networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48183&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg?resize=900%2C237&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress User Installations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress User Installations
&lt;p&gt;One statistic I&amp;#8217;m proud of is that 29% of the respondents found out about the survey through WP Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48184&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png?resize=854%2C328&quot; alt=&quot;How People Found Out About The Survey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The most wanted features in a bbPress theme are, Responsive (69.5%), Light and Fresh Design (52%), and Compatible with the latest bbPress version (49%). A preference for Responsive, mobile-first themes is in fourth place at 39%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, Attachments (42.5%), Ajaxification of Topics and Replies (41.5%), and Moderation tools in the front end (39%) are the most requested features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48196&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png?resize=463%2C219&quot; alt=&quot;2015 Most Requested Features&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2015 Most Requested Features
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of bbPress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercime, a BuddyPress and bbPress core contributor, confirmed at the end of the survey that the bbPress project is alive and well. According to Mercime, the development team is in the middle of a large migration project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/src/humans.txt&quot;&gt;bbPress core team&lt;/a&gt; has been involved in the process of migrating the WordPress Support Forums (English and all Rosetta sites) from bbPress 1.x.x to bbPress 2.5.8 starting with one European-language forums subsite which has been already ported and being tested on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this migration has been discussed many times and often over the years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;@johnjamesjacoby&lt;/a&gt; formally started the process when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/05/15/wp-org-forums-plugins-audit/&quot;&gt;posted the results of an audit&lt;/a&gt; to show the custom functionality required for a successful migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involves multiple teams including, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;WP Support team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/&quot;&gt;WP Meta Team&lt;/a&gt;. The migration will impact more than 8 million users on WordPress.org. Any improvements made to bbPress to ease the migration process are going to be merged back into the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Confirms It Did Not Have a Security Breach</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48173</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpml-confirms-it-did-not-have-a-security-breach</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When WPML emailed new &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext&quot;&gt;passwords to customers in plaintext&lt;/a&gt;, some customers thought it was due to a security breach. Amit Kvint, compatibility team leader for WPML, confirmed the emails are not a result of a security breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/2015/09/password-update-email-from-wpml/&quot;&gt;post on the official WPML blog&lt;/a&gt;, Kvint says the emails were a preventive measure to insure accounts remain secure, &amp;#8220;The main purpose and underlying principle for this action was making sure everyone has a good new strong password, we consider this an important step in online security,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvint acknowledges the improvements in WordPress 4.3 in how passwords are handled and admits that sending passwords in plaintext was not a good idea, &amp;#8220;The best practice would be, once the password is sent, to login and reset the password to a new strong one. We will definitely revise the way this is done in the future,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog post does not go into detail in how they determined passwords to be weak. To the best of my knowledge, WPML does not have a policy in place to enforce strong passwords. While no accounts were compromised, if some of the contacted customers choose a weak password, wouldn&amp;#8217;t it defeat the purpose of resetting passwords in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jetpack 3.7 Introduces a Simpler Interface, Adds Support for Development Sites</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48161</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-7-introduces-a-simpler-interface-adds-support-for-development-sites</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/2015/09/09/jetpack-3-7-simpler-ui-support-for-development-sites-and-more/&quot;&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt; and includes a simpler user interface, support for development sites, and fixes several issues with a variety of modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new interface separates some of Jetpack&amp;#8217;s functionality into categories such as, performance and security, traffic growth, and WordPress.com tools. The most commonly used modules are listed first with a link underneath that takes users to the other 27 modules and the old settings page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48162&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png?resize=968%2C492&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack 3.7 Interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack 3.7 Interface
&lt;p&gt;Turning a module on or off is accomplished by clicking a toggle. Services you need to pay for are clearly marked with links to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest drawbacks to Jetpack is switching between a local server or staging environment. If you move your site from one URL to another, Jetpack automatically detects the change and prompts the user to confirm if the URL is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48163&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png?resize=1025%2C155&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack on a staging site&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack on a staging site
&lt;p&gt;If Jetpack thinks two URLs are separate websites, it recommends that you create a new connection to prevent a service interruption on the original domain. The prompt has links to reset the connection, confirm that the URL is part of a development environment, or submit a trouble ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48164&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png?resize=1025%2C143&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites
&lt;p&gt;The VideoPress player in Jetpack 3.7 works on mobile devices thanks to its responsive redesign. Having VideoPress enabled allows you to easily embed VideoPress powered videos to your site by copying and pasting the video&amp;#8217;s URL into the visual editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other changes included in 3.7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to enable per-post opt-out for Subscriptions by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/support/subscriptions/#filters&quot;&gt;adding a filter&lt;/a&gt; to a functionality plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new Widget Visibility rule that allows you to show or hide widgets based on a page’s parent.&lt;/li&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: A Conceptual WordPress Plugin by Stephen Cronin That Makes Comment Moderation Easier</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48149</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-conceptual-wordpress-plugin-by-stephen-cronin-that-makes-comment-moderation-easier</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Moderating replies to comments in the backend of WordPress is tough. For example, WordPress 4.3 displays the reply and who it&amp;#8217;s in response too, but doesn&amp;#8217;t show the text of the parent comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t see the parent comment unless you open the author link in a new browser tab. This is not an optimal user experience and makes it more difficult to determine if the reply is from a spammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48150&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png?resize=851%2C161&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;Show Parent Comment&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Cronin, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/&quot;&gt;Scratch99 Design&lt;/a&gt;, is a potential solution to the problem. Simply activate and browse to the comment section of the WordPress backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show Parent Comment displays the text of the parent comment inside the reply. This helps moderators keep track of the conversation and helps to identify copy/paste spammers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48151&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png?resize=847%2C223&quot; alt=&quot;Show Parent Comment Plugin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easy Way to See The Parent Comment
&lt;p&gt;While the plugin works as advertised and shows the parent comment text, the interface needs to be improved. I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of the background color and some of the comment information is repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea is to replace the &lt;strong&gt;In Reply to Author&lt;/strong&gt; text to say, &lt;strong&gt;In Response To&lt;/strong&gt;. The show more or less button is a good idea but I think the text size needs to be increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Show Parent Comment is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;plugin directory for free&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s a proof of concept and is not officially supported by Cronin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept needs work but I think something similar needs to be added to WordPress core. As it stands, moderating comment replies is not a great experience and I think Cronin&amp;#8217;s plugin is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Emails Passwords to Affected Customers in Plaintext</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48123</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-31477&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png?resize=637%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Clear Text Password&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/thegloaming/1402099967/&quot;&gt;thegloaming&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;Customers who purchased &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/&quot;&gt;WPML&lt;/a&gt;, a multilingual plugin for WordPress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-699832&quot;&gt;are receiving&lt;/a&gt; a suspicious email that looks similar to a phishing attempt. Matt Radford, a customer of WPML, kindly sent the Tavern a copy of the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Matt&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure that your WPML account remains secure. For this, we are updating all client accounts with auto-generated strong passwords. A strong password helps prevent unauthorized use of your WPML account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our system will start the password update shortly. We will send you another email with your new password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WPML team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radford received a follow-up email that includes his new password in plaintext. WPML explains why the passwords were sent in plaintext, &amp;#8220;We detected weak passwords in our system and following this we are enforcing, on a one-time procedure, strong passwords to all our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As for sending them in plaintext, if you consider it not to be safe, please update your password in order to keep it secure,&amp;#8221; WPML said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When questioned if passwords are stored in plaintext within the database, WPML replied, &amp;#8220;As for storing passwords in our database we are not storing it in plaintext, we are using standard WordPress. Yes they&amp;#8217;re salted and hashed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise VanDeCruze, a WPML support forum moderator, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-700143&quot;&gt;the email was generated automatically&lt;/a&gt; from their systems. She confirms that sending passwords in plaintext is not a best practice and urges users to login to their accounts and generate a new password using the reset password link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This email was automatically generated by our system and sent to clients with passwords that were deemed too simple. However, sending new passwords in plain text via email without requiring user action is not best practice. I urge you to change your WPML account password. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were right to be cautious of this sudden email. Although it was not a phishing attempt, it was not the best way to ensure a safe password. In the future we will be mindful of adhering to strict security standards. Please let me know if you have any further questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WPML has not published any information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/blog/&quot;&gt;its blog&lt;/a&gt; that explains the situation and has yet to respond to our requests for comment. If you&amp;#8217;re a WPML customer and receive an email with a new password, you should immediately login and generate a new password using the site&amp;#8217;s reset password link and follow the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emailing passwords in plaintext is a terrible security practice. One of the key improvements in WordPress 4.3 is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/&quot;&gt;WordPress no longer emails passwords&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it sends password reset links that expire after 24 hours. In hindsight, WPML should have generated and sent password reset emails to affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Help Me Add Comment Approval Notifications to WordPress</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48059</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/help-me-add-comment-approval-notifications-to-wordpress</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy&quot;&gt;enabling comment moderation&lt;/a&gt; on the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;ve discovered that WordPress does not notify commenters when their comments are approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;m using the &lt;a title=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot;&gt;Comment Approved&lt;/a&gt; plugin by &lt;a title=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot; href=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot;&gt;Niels van Renselaar&lt;/a&gt;. It allows me to create a custom notification message that is sent when a comment is approved. Unfortunately, I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s working. Please let me know if you&amp;#8217;ve received any comment approval emails from the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe this feature should be in core. I&amp;#8217;ve started the process by creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717&quot;&gt;feature request ticket&lt;/a&gt; on WordPress trac. Let&amp;#8217;s discuss the pros and cons or why you think it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be in core. Please give me your feedback in the comments or within the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: How Chris Klosowski’s Lifestyle Changed by Writing One WordPress Plugin</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48051</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/how-chris-klosowskis-lifestyle-changed-by-writing-one-wordpress-plugin</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Klosowski, co-lead developer of Easy Digital Downloads, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kungfugrep.com/2015/09/how-writing-one-plugin-changed-my-lifestyle/&quot;&gt;explains how writing one plugin&lt;/a&gt; changed his lifestyle. He left his corporate job to be a full-time distributed worker and being a distributed worker comes with its own set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My truest challenge in this new lifestyle is knowing when it’s time to ignore Slack, shut off email, take off the Pebble, and just spend time with my family. It’s a challenge I’m learning to face, and the hardest part is admitting to myself that it’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s come up in conversation a couple times with my wife, and every time, she lets me know when I’m failing. Honesty here is the key. Not guilt, not anger, just brutal honesty of when I’m not being the best husband and dad because I’m putting work before them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges a distributed worker faces is figuring out the balance between work, family, and personal life. If you&amp;#8217;re struggling to find balance, I encourage you to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-mantra-of-family-comes-first&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and the nearly 100 comments that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments are from people in similar positions trying to figure out how to balance work, life, and family. After nearly three years of being a distributed worker, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Bug in Chrome 45 Causes WordPress Admin Menu to Break</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48045</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-bug-in-chrome-45-causes-wordpress-admin-menu-to-break</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Within the last five weeks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33199&quot;&gt;several people have reported&lt;/a&gt; an issue in Chrome that breaks the WordPress admin menu. If you hover the mouse cursor over menu items in the sidebar, they&amp;#8217;ll occasionally fall out-of-place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48046&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png?resize=764%2C543&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome WordPress Admin Menu &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using Chrome 45.0.2454.85, I&amp;#8217;m able to inconsistently reproduce the behaviour reported in the ticket. Through the process of elimination, users discovered Chrome is the software at fault and not WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179#c17&quot;&gt;source of the problem&lt;/a&gt; stems from Slimming Paint which is enabled by default in Chrome 45. Disabling slimming paint fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable this feature, visit &lt;strong&gt;chrome://flags/#disable-slimming-paint&lt;/strong&gt; in Chrome and &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Disable slimming paint&lt;/em&gt; option, and make sure the other two &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; options are disabled because they will override the Disable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds confusing, please refer to the following screenshot provided by Samuel Wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48056&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png?resize=839%2C185&quot; alt=&quot;Disable Slimming Paint Options&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Disable Slimming Paint Options
&lt;p&gt;Chrome&amp;#8217;s development team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179&amp;q=label%3AM-47%20slimming%20paint&amp;colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified&quot;&gt;aware of the issue&lt;/a&gt; and is working towards a solution that is marked for release in Chrome 47. Until then, users are encouraged to disable Slimming Paint until Chrome fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Dashboard Widget That Displays New Registered Users</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48037</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-dashboard-widget-that-displays-new-registered-users</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you run a WordPress site with user registration enabled and want to see recently registered accounts from the dashboard, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/new-user-dashboard/&quot;&gt;New User Dashboard Widget plugin&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/swadeshswain/&quot;&gt;Swadeshswain&lt;/a&gt;. After installing and activating the plugin, a new registered user widget appears on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48038&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png?resize=536%2C146&quot; alt=&quot;New Registered User Widget&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New Registered User Widget
&lt;p&gt;The widget tells you a user&amp;#8217;s registration date, name, and role. If you don&amp;#8217;t see the widget after activating the plugin, click on the Screen Options tab and make sure the box next to New User is checked. New User Dashboard Widget is the type of plugin that does one thing only and does it well. There&amp;#8217;s nothing to configure and it works out-of-the-box with WordPress 4.3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Proposal to Overhaul the Shortcode API in WordPress Goes Back to the Drawing Board</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48026</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/proposal-to-overhaul-the-shortcode-api-in-wordpress-goes-back-to-the-drawing-board</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/miqrogroove&quot;&gt;Robert Chapin&lt;/a&gt;, who contributes to WordPress core, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;published the first draft&lt;/a&gt; of a roadmap that explains how the Shortcode API could be overhauled. &amp;#8220;The decision to create this roadmap arose from specific needs that are not met by the old code,&amp;#8221; Chapin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has an aggressive timeline with development starting in WordPress 4.4 and ending in WordPress 4.7. In WordPress 4.4, a new syntax would be introduced that provides opportunities to make significant changes to the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of shortcodes that use the new syntax.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Self-Closing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode attr1=&amp;#8221;value1&amp;#8243; attr2=&amp;#8217;value2&amp;#8242; &amp;#8220;value3&amp;#8221; &amp;#8216;value4&amp;#8217; value5}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Enclosures&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${encl2}$] HTML [${encl3}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escaped Code&lt;/strong&gt;: [!{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the WordPress 4.5 development cycle, the focus would be to deprecate the old syntax, &amp;#8220;Plugins that register shortcodes without declaring support for new features will raise debugging errors to alert developers that support for the old shortcode syntax is ending,&amp;#8221; Chapin said. Posts using the old syntax would  continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the WordPress 4.6 update process, shortcodes using the old syntax would be converted to use the new syntax. The Shortcode API would continue to provide deprecated support for the old syntax to provide a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important point to note is that the new syntax does not support HTML inside of shortcode attributes. This leaves the potential for many sites to break as shortcodes may not perform the same way prior to WordPress 4.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition process ends with WordPress 4.7 where support for the old syntax is eliminated. Shortcodes and plugins that use the old syntax would stop working. During the WordPress 4.7 update process, a second attempt would be made to upgrade old content to use the new syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Proposal Raises Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has drawn constructive criticism from several members of the WordPress community. Nick Haskins, founder of Aesop Interactive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27426&quot;&gt;voiced his concern&lt;/a&gt; saying the syntax isn&amp;#8217;t easier for authors to use and will affect a large number of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://halfelf.org/&quot;&gt;Mika Epstein&lt;/a&gt;, who voluntarily moderates the WordPress.org support forums and interacts with users on a daily basis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27472&quot;&gt;sums up a list of concerns&lt;/a&gt; that many developers agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the plugins and themes on the planet we will break (because we will, they won’t read or test). We have to degrade them as gracefully as humanly possibly. Continuing to say “Well the developers were notified and should have updated” now that we’re as big as we are is not sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the very (legitimately) angry end users who are broken because they didn’t upgrade plugins and themes (or the themes/plugins didn’t get updated). People were rightly angry last time. It’s the end users, not the developers, who will be hardest hit by this change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating clearly to the users that it’s now &lt;code&gt;{{gallery}}&lt;/code&gt;. That’s going to be very hard. Incredibly hard. Updating their old posts (keeping in mind Justin’s Markdown caveat and those who use them as an aside – I know I know) is easier than making sure everyone knows what to do. At best we can keep tabs on the ones built into WP and perhaps use the logic we have in the visual editor NOW to convert them, but we have to figure out how to make sure everyone knows. This is nothing like the move of Menus to customizer. That was confusing, but the users could see what happened. This is a legit change, your old way is no longer going to work. That is huge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of users who have premium themes and plugins that &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; get update alerts. These people are simply not going to know they need to update and this is not their fault. We should never be breaking them if there’s possibly any alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users will be upgraded by their hosts vis-a-vis one-click installs and managed hosting so they will have up to date WP and out of date plugins/themes. So yes, many users will be on 4.7 and then a theme from 2014. It sucks, it’s the reality, we know it’s the reality, we cannot stick our heads in the sand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugins that are already using {{template}} tags in their code. Yeah, I’ve seen it. Most of them use it for search/replace within their own code, but we’ll want to make sure we check for everyone in the repo who might be doing it on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best argument against using the new shortcode syntax is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27518&quot;&gt;made by Stefano Agiletti.&lt;/a&gt; Agiletti says Italian keyboards don&amp;#8217;t have keys that create curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe English people don’t know that { and } are not present in all keyboards directly as the [ and ] are. On Italian keyboards [ and ] are generated using ALT-GR+è or ALT-GR++ and keyboards show ALT-GR basic sign like €@## and [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get { and } you need to type ALT-GR+SHIFT+è and ALT-GR+SHIFT++. Most people don’t know about this combination (I think only those who write code do) and the parentheses are not written on any key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the Drawing Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a considerable amount of feedback and concerns shared by developers, the proposal is heading back to the drawing board. In a comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27484&quot;&gt;summarizing the feedback&lt;/a&gt;, Andrew Nacin confirms that the new shortcode syntax does not fit the core team&amp;#8217;s vision of being easy and intuitive for non-technical authors to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he cautions that the team needs to do something, &amp;#8220;The proposed syntax significantly clashes with the proposed vision and given all of your feedback, we’re clearly going to have to go back to the drawing board. Please note that &lt;strong&gt;we still need to do something&lt;/strong&gt;, but maybe we can think further outside the box.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly encourage you to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;proposal and the comments&lt;/a&gt; that follow it. It&amp;#8217;s a great read that highlights how difficult it will be to make changes to the Shortcode API that don&amp;#8217;t end up causing a lot of sites to break.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48012</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who regularly comment on the Tavern may have noticed that your comments don&amp;#8217;t show up immediately after submitting them. That&amp;#8217;s because about four weeks ago, for the first time in the Tavern&amp;#8217;s history, comment moderation for all comments was enabled. I enabled moderation to address concerns raised by members of the community and to sleep better at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the request of a few readers and to be more transparent, I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/comment-policy&quot;&gt;comment moderation policy&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of at least a dozen people, I&amp;#8217;ve crafted a policy that is easy to read and more importantly, easy to follow. It explains our expectations, has a few tips on writing better comments, and lists possible reasons a comment may be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;&gt;CC0 licensed&lt;/a&gt; which is the least restrictive license offered by Creative Commons. Feel free to copy and modify it for your own use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strive to create a fun, friendly, and inviting atmosphere. The ground rules for commenting on WP Tavern are simple. Treat people the way you want to be treated. Try to understand someone else’s perspective and if you disagree, respectfully explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text is a difficult medium to decipher context. Emoticons and emoji help, but it doesn’t solve the problem. Take a deep breath and assume the commenter has the best of intentions before responding and approach discussions with open minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome different perspectives and viewpoints but we all need to clearly communicate them without tearing the opposition down in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay on point using concise language. If your comment is more than a few paragraphs long, consider publishing it on your own site instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your comment may be deleted if it matches any of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocates an illegal practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses vulgar, profane, or unnecessarily harsh language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is spam or appears to be written primarily to post a link or advertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is written anonymously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains copyrighted material not licensed for distribution on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impersonates another user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains an affiliate link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal insults, including those using racist or sexist terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines are not meant to be an exhaustive list. The deletion of comments is wholly within the discretion of the moderators at WP Tavern and we will err on the side of maintaining a safe and friendly community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;How Do I Report Comments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe a comment published on WP Tavern violates any of the listed guidelines or that you feel needs special attention, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/contact-me&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;. Please do not publicly report comments using social media such as Facebook or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form submissions are sent to authors with comment moderation capabilities. Include a link to the comment in your email with a short explanation as to why it needs our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to reestablish the comment section as a place where people feel welcome to voice their opinions without the fear of being ripped apart. We encourage criticism, disagreements, and open conversation but it needs to take place in a respectful manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: A Day of REST — a conference devoted to the WordPress REST API</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14173</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/a-day-of-rest-a-conference-devoted-to-the-wordpress-rest-api/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;A Day of REST&lt;/a&gt; will be the first ever event dedicated to the WordPress REST API. It&amp;#8217;ll happen on January 28th 2016, with a follow-on hack day on the 29th, and will be held at Bishopsgate Institute in London, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is aimed at developers who want to learn how to interact with the new WordPress REST API. From WordPress developers to Javascript developers, to application developers, A Day of REST promises to provide in-depth information that covers every aspect of the WordPress REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of event I&amp;#8217;ve been hoping to see in the WordPress community. Sessions will vary from an introduction to the WordPress REST API to in-depth case studies and guides on utilizing it in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an incredible and rare opportunity to learn from the people making the API and those extending it further than anyone else. A niche event to be sure, A Day of REST  is a big bet on the WordPress REST API &amp;#8212; which is not yet slated for core, but is widely expected to make it to core in the next few releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference is being organized to supply a clear demand for more information, resources, and education on the subject. At most WordCamps, REST API sessions seem to be some of the most crowded, with the most engaged and curious audiences. A Day of REST will be like those sessions, but much bigger, as the entire day will be dedicated to the single topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is speaking at A Day of REST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14179&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/speakers-day-of-rest-752x603.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;speakers-day-of-rest&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker roster consists of people who are building the WordPress REST API, and those who are already using it for production applications and websites. The speakers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan McCue &amp;#8211;  WordPress REST API co-lead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Hoyle &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Bachhuber &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen Vignos &amp;#8211; Director of Engineering, WIRED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K. Adam White &amp;#8211; Open Web Engineer, Bocoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Lenox &amp;#8211; Design Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Taylor &amp;#8211; Senior Engineer, New York Times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski &amp;#8211; Meta Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post Status will be an official partner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really pleased that Post Status will be the official content partner for A Day of REST. That means I’ll be attending the event, and I&amp;#8217;ll offer a number of in-depth posts related to the WordPress REST API, the sessions, interviews, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll also manage content for some of the larger event announcements, like this one. I&amp;#8217;ve known the organizers for a long time, and they are big supporters of Post Status. A Day of REST offers a really great opportunity for me to work with them and offer my readers some unique privileges and exclusive content for a subject that&amp;#8217;s of interest to most of my audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So who is organizing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14180&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/humans-752x333.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;humans&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/organizations/human-made/&quot;&gt;Human Made&lt;/a&gt;, who’ve brought on board &lt;a href=&quot;http://siobhanmckeown.com/about/&quot;&gt;Siobhan McKeown&lt;/a&gt; to lead the charge putting the event together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Made uses the API in a good bit of their services and product work, are really interested to see more adoption of the API, and are eager to provide education resources so that can happen. Those of you who pay close attention may know that two of Human Made&amp;#8217;s own are actually part of the team of four that does much of the REST API development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rmccue&quot;&gt;Ryan McCue&lt;/a&gt; is the project co-lead, and is generally steering the ship; the API started as his GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle&quot;&gt;Joe Hoyle&lt;/a&gt; is in day to day conversations for project direction and also commits a lot of code to the API; he is a co-founder of Human Made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hack Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 29th January 2016, there will be a WordPress REST API hack day. This event is being hosted by Mozilla Spaces in London. Space for the hack day is limited but the team would love for anyone interested to come along and help make the WordPress REST API. Bring a laptop and expect to get hacking. This event will be for building the REST API specifically, and not geared toward other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ticket details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/tickets/&quot;&gt;from the website&lt;/a&gt;. They’re £125 (+ VAT &amp;amp; booking fees) &amp;#8212; which ends up being around $235 US &amp;#8212; and the price includes all of the usual conference goodies: presentations, lunch, swag, and an informal afterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confirmed sponsors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is excited to already have some awesome sponsors on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prospress.com/&quot;&gt;ProsPress&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sucuri.net/&quot;&gt;Sucuri&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is also looking for more sponsors to get involved and help make this unique event happen. If you’d like to sponsor, send an email to events@humanmade.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the content, you can get updates either from this blog, or from the A Day of REST website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;feelingrestful.com&lt;/a&gt;. You should also follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/feelingrestful&quot;&gt;@feelingrestful&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for live updates. I&amp;#8217;ll have in-depth content and broader event information and the event site will have more general announcements, news, and event updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is quite accessible from much of the world, so I am hopeful and confident that there will be a diverse audience in attendance. I certainly look forward to visiting; and I was pleasantly surprised that it doesn&amp;#8217;t get as cold there as I thought; January temperatures (lows and highs) stay around the 40s (F, or 5-9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_default&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_unit_c&quot;&gt;°&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; C) &amp;#8212; which is likely warmer than it&amp;#8217;ll be where I live in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is an exciting development in the WordPress conference ecosystem and I&amp;#8217;m confident it&amp;#8217;s going to be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Envato Implements Item Support Policy for ThemeForest and CodeCanyon</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47990</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/envato-implements-item-support-policy-for-themeforest-and-codecanyon</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In August of 2014, Envato &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/news/item-support-sustainability-authors-clarity-buyers/&quot;&gt;announced a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; that would allow sellers on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codecanyon.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;CodeCanyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;ThemeForest&lt;/a&gt; to inform buyers whether or not an item is supported. Earlier today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/releases/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/&quot;&gt;Envato implemented&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;Item Support Policy&lt;/a&gt; for sellers on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When browsing items on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, a blue badge indicates the seller provides support. There&amp;#8217;s also a badge and text that informs potential buyers if an item is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47991&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png?resize=639%2C408&quot; alt=&quot;This Item is Supported&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This Item is Supported
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt;, buyers automatically receive six months of support from the date of purchase. If you need support for an entire year, you can buy an extension for a nominal upgrade fee. Envato takes 30% and gives 70% of the purchase to authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of a &lt;b&gt;6-month support extension&lt;/b&gt; for a &lt;b&gt;Regular License&lt;/b&gt; is calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37.5% of the item price (30% of the list price) when purchased at the same time as the license;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;62.5% of the item price (50% of the list price) when purchased during the support period; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87.5% of the item price (70% of the list price) when purchased after the support period has ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Freeman, product manager for Envato, says the changes provide a standardized definition of support, &amp;#8220;Buyers will know exactly what to expect from all purchases on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers who purchased supported items before the new policy went into effect have six months of free tech support starting on September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disgruntled Authors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.envato.com/t/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/3619&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; with over 165 responses, sellers discussed the pros and cons of the policy while some expressed anger. &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/user/jonathan01&quot;&gt;Jonathan Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr3ativ.com/&quot;&gt;Cr3ativ&lt;/a&gt;, who sells several items on ThemeForest, thinks the policy is not as good as alternatives offered outside of the marketplaces because of its confusing complexity for both authors and buyers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure why Envato chose this solution when we already have a well established support/upgrade system in place within most of the WordPress community where 12 months of support is included in the purchase and customers receive a 50% discount to continue receiving support and updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is a work in progress, &amp;#8220;We will be monitoring the impacts of this change very closely and will be tweaking, improving and enhancing the support tools over coming weeks and months,&amp;#8221; Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a buyer or seller on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, let us know what you think of the support policy in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Twenty Sixteen Now Available on GitHub and the WordPress Theme Directory</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47973</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/twenty-sixteen-now-available-on-github-and-the-wordpress-theme-directory</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen, the default theme scheduled to ship with WordPress 4.4, is available for download on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/&quot;&gt;WordPress theme directory&lt;/a&gt;. According &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/29/twenty-sixteen-is-now-on-github/&quot;&gt;to Tammie Lister&lt;/a&gt;, Twenty Sixteen will be developed as if it were a feature plugin and will merge into WordPress core later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development takes place on GitHub, changes will regularly sync up to the WordPress theme directory. By installing and activating Twenty Sixteen from the theme directory, users can easily update to new versions as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Twenty Sixteen has 23 issues and 27 pull requests on GitHub. Many of the issues such as, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/pull/23&quot;&gt;introducing automated Travis CI build testing into Twenty Sixteen,&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/labels/discussion&quot;&gt;up for discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the top half of the Tavern looks like with Twenty Sixteen activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47974&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=1025%2C563&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the content section looks like. Notice the block of code that displays instead of an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47976&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=881%2C648&quot; alt=&quot;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen Activated
&lt;p&gt;Testers are encouraged to open issues and pull requests on GitHub. If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with how GitHub works, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; explains how to contribute to the Twenty Sixteen project. Keep in mind that Twenty Sixteen is a work in progress and should not be used in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress.com Unveils the Action Bar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47954</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-unveils-the-action-bar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/new-action-bar/&quot;&gt;unveiled a new user interface&lt;/a&gt; called the Action Bar. It&amp;#8217;s a bar that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen for logged in users and is accessible from any device. The bar performs multiple tasks depending on the page you&amp;#8217;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47955&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png?resize=1025%2C627&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Action Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress Action Bar
&lt;p&gt;When on a WordPress.com powered site that you&amp;#8217;re not following, the bar turns into a Follow button. Clicking the follow button will notify you of new posts published on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47956&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png?resize=192%2C60&quot; alt=&quot;Action Bar Follow Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Action Bar Follow Button
&lt;p&gt;If you click the three dots to the right, you&amp;#8217;ll see a variety of options depending upon the page you&amp;#8217;re viewing. If it&amp;#8217;s the homepage, you&amp;#8217;ll see links to download the theme the site uses, report the content, or manage the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re browsing a specific post on a WordPress.com site, you&amp;#8217;ll see an additional link to copy a shortlink for quick and easy sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47957&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png?resize=265%2C319&quot; alt=&quot;Easily Share Posts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easily Share Posts
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com and are logged in, the Follow button turns into a Customize button. This link provides a quick way to enter the Customizer. There&amp;#8217;s also an Edit link if you&amp;#8217;re browsing a published post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47958&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png?resize=307%2C348&quot; alt=&quot;Edit and Customize Links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Edit and Customize Links
&lt;p&gt;If the action bar is too big and you want to minimize it, click the three dots and select the option to Collapse the bar. It will shrink the bar into squares and get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the action bar is the ability to quickly see and download a theme used on a WordPress.com site. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for WordPress.com specific sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailypost.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The Daily Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What annoys me about the action bar is that it disappears when I scroll down. I caught myself scrolling down to read a post and when I looked for the edit button to fix a typo, the action bar was gone. I think it should stay on the screen at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to see the Edit link in the action bar open a front-end editor. It&amp;#8217;s time WordPress.com step up its game and stop forcing users through a backend interface to edit published content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the experimental action bar but at the same time, I question the reasoning for adding yet another user interface element to mimic actions already supported by other buttons and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, between the admin bar, dashboard, the edit link underneath a post, and the action bar, there are now four different ways to edit a post. How many roads are necessary to reach the same destination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com, let me know what you think of the action bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.3.3 Patches Security Vulnerabilities in BuddyPress Messages Component</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47948</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-3-patches-security-vulnerabilities-in-buddypress-messages-component</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-41978&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=828%2C265&quot; alt=&quot;BuddyPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3&lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2015/08/buddypress-2-3-3/&quot;&gt; is available&lt;/a&gt; and users are encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;update as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. A few security vulnerabilities were discovered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/buddypress-components-and-features/#internal-messaging&quot;&gt;BuddyPress Messages, &lt;/a&gt;a core component that allows users to send and receive private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to the BuddyPress team that could allow members to manipulate a failed private outbound message and inject unexpected output to the browser. The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof Katowicz-Kowalewski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the first vulnerability, the BuddyPress core development team independently discovered and fixed related vulnerabilities with the messages component that could allow for carefully crafted private message content to be rendered incorrectly to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3 also fixes a couple of bugs in the 2.3 codebase and improves support for backend changes made in WordPress 4.3. To protect your sites from these vulnerabilities, you should perform a full backup and &lt;strong&gt;update BuddyPress as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Theme Review Team Begins Phasing Out Favicon Support</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47940</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-begins-phasing-out-favicon-support</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main features in WordPress 4.3 are Site Icons. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icon&lt;/a&gt; is an image that represents a website across multiple platforms and replaces Favicons. With Site Icons in WordPress core, the WordPress Theme Review team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;phasing out the feature&lt;/a&gt; in existing themes hosted in the theme directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;p&gt;Justin Tadlock, a theme review admin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;published a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to provide a backwards compatible experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tadlock, the easiest method is to check if the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; function exists. This tells you if the user is running WordPress 4.3 and has the site icon feature available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check if the user has set up a new icon using the core WordPress feature by using the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; conditional tag which returns either &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some example code from the tutorial you can use to handle the check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ( ! function_exists( 'has_site_icon' ) || ! has_site_icon() ) {

    // Output old, custom favicon feature.
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional information, I encourage you to read&lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/wordpress/development/backwards-compatibility-site-icons/&quot;&gt; Stephen Cronin&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; which goes into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Theme Review Team enforces a guideline where features added to core are phased out of themes within two major releases. By the time WordPress 4.5 is released, theme authors will be able to remove legacy code without disrupting the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress Community Summit Set for December 2-3, 2015</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47930</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-summit-set-for-december-2-3-2015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/08/26/2015-wordpress-community-summit-dates-announced/&quot;&gt;WordPress community summit&lt;/a&gt; will take place on December 2-3, 2015, in Philadelphia, PA two days before WordCamp US. The summit&amp;nbsp;will be held at &lt;a href=&quot;http://philadelphia.impacthub.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Impact Hub Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, a co-working space where freelancers, entrepreneurs, and social innovators work together, share ideas, and build networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ImpactHub.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47931&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ImpactHub.jpg?resize=500%2C333&quot; alt=&quot;inside Impact Hub&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Inside Impact HubImpact Hub is spacious and has dedicated meeting and conference rooms. According to the announcement, the summit is invite only similar to last year’s event at WordCamp San Francisco:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WordPress Community Summit is a smaller, invite-only event for&amp;nbsp;active members and contributors on the many teams that work to improve&amp;nbsp;WordPress: Core, Design, Mobile, Accessibility, Support, Polygots, Documentation, Themes, Plugins, Community, Meta, Training, Flow&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;TV .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey or application form will soon be published which will result in a pool from which the attendees will be invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit is a rare opportunity for members of various contributor teams to focus and work together in the same physical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual WordPress Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use, build, or make a living with WordPress, please take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2015&quot;&gt;annual survey&lt;/a&gt;. Results will be shared during Matt Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation at WordCamp US. The more people who fill out the survey, the more representative the data will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation from 2014 to see results from the previous survey.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Stream Is Shutting Down Its Cloud Data Storage October 1st</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47925</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/stream-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-data-storage-october-1st</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/introducing-stream-3/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt; and includes some significant improvements. Stream is a WordPress plugin that tracks changes to a site similar to an audit trail. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service&quot;&gt;version two was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, it morphed from a plugin to a service. Activity logs were stored in the cloud which lessened the amount of resources used on local webservers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version three will no longer store data in the cloud. Instead, it will store activity logs locally. The cloud service provided by Stream 2 is closing on &lt;strong&gt;October 1st&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives users a little more than a month to migrate data from the cloud to their local webserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cloud is Expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Carbis, lead developer of Stream, says the time frame was chosen based on a number of factors, &amp;#8220;We chose a 6 week migration window as a balance between bleeding cash and doing the right thing by our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s also helpful to remember that the vast majority of our users are on a Free plan, which only includes 12 weeks of storage. We are monitoring the accounts of each of our paid users and I&amp;#8217;m personally making sure that every one of them has migrated,&amp;#8221; Carbis told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move away from the cloud is largely based on cost. The majority of Stream&amp;#8217;s customers signed up to the free plan with a significant lack of interest in the Pro Subscription. Server costs were also higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XWP to The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lack of income from Stream 2 and acquisition talks failing, Carbis was contracted to do outside work leaving Frankie Jarrett the only person working on the project. Stream&amp;#8217;s investor decided to pull the plug on the project at the same time Jarrett decided to resign from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I heard that Frankie had resigned I gave him a call. We reminisced on our achievements, and threw around some of our ideas on what could have been. That conversation renewed my inspiration. I jotted down some notes, and that’s when things started to turn around,&amp;#8221; Carbis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members from &lt;a href=&quot;https://xwp.co/&quot;&gt;XWP&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to lend a helping hand and the project is now officially under the XWP umbrella. This allows Stream to remain free and open source. The partnership will also facilitate add-on, connectors, and adapters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New in Stream 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is rewritten from the ground up. Activity logs use half the space in the database compared to Stream 2. It supports multisite through the use of Network Admin and uses a dependency injection model to be more extendable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Stream 3 includes a variety of improvements two notable features have been removed, Notifications and Reports. If you depend on these features, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/stream-3-faq/&quot;&gt;review the following FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbis and XWP are taking Stream into a new direction. Stream&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wp-stream/roadmap/&quot;&gt;proposed roadmap&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub and Carbis encourages users to not only review it, but to contribute to the project&amp;#8217;s future, &amp;#8220;I’d like to see Stream’s users contribute more to its direction. Contribution isn’t limited to ideas either. If you can design, develop, or translate, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wp-stream/stream&quot;&gt;contributing to the Stream project&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if Stream can regain the momentum it lost after transitioning to a cloud based system to store data. Now that Stream stores activity logs locally again, those in the EU should be able to use it without breaking privacy laws. Stream is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; on the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Akismet: Quantifying Reddit Bigotry</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1859</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/08/27/quantifying-reddit-bigotry/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2015-08-30): It looks like the team who created the tool decided to retire it due to some reported accuracy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never pass on the opportunity to mix in a little bit of humor with our passion for web content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our engineers, Dan Walmsley, participated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedyhackday.org/la-2015&quot;&gt;Cultivated Wit&amp;#8217;s Comedy Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles last weekend, and his team&amp;#8217;s resulting project has since surfaced on &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-tool-quantifies-reddit-bigotry&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/26/reddit-bigotry-check/&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeredditcheck.com/&quot;&gt;Free Reddit Check&lt;/a&gt;, created by Dan&amp;#8217;s team and crowned with the day&amp;#8217;s top prize, is a site which attempts to quantify the terribleness of Reddit users based on their public comment content and subreddit participation. While perfectly suited for a hack day which pairs developers and comedians, there is certainly usefulness in determining the respectability of a potential online acquaintance. Or just knowing who to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being obsessed with content analysis, community moderation, and keeping the web&amp;#8217;s underbelly in check, we can&amp;#8217;t help but think it&amp;#8217;s a nifty idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1859&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: First Look at the Twenty Sixteen Default WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47897</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.4 is the last scheduled major release of the year and with it will come a new default theme to replace Twenty Fifteen. On the Make WordPress Core site, Tammie Lister &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/25/introducing-twenty-sixteen/&quot;&gt;published an image gallery&lt;/a&gt; that shows off the design of Twenty Sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lister, the process of determining the new default theme has taken months, &amp;#8220;Lots of themes were considered, eventually settling on the one you see below. It’s a perfect fit,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47898&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png?resize=433%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen
&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen is designed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi&quot;&gt;Takashi Irie,&lt;/a&gt; who also designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2013/12/13/twenty-fourteen-wordpress-3-8-parker/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fourteen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2015/03/19/twenty-fifteen-the-wordpress-default-theme-for-2015/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; default themes. Irie describes Twenty Sixteen as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modernized approach of an ever-popular layout — a horizontal masthead and an optional right sidebar that works well with both blogs and websites. It has custom color options that allow you to make your own Twenty Sixteen. The theme was designed on a harmonious fluid grid with a mobile first approach. This means it looks great on any device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theme has hints of Twenty Fourteen but is different enough to stand on its own as a unique design. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look as modern as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; out-of-the box but the design could change during the 4.4 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help Twenty Sixteen be the best it can be, please join the weekly meetings held every Monday and Friday at 16:00 UTC in the #core-themes channel on &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt;. The meetings are a half hour-long and start once the theme is initially added to WordPress core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think of Twenty Sixteen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: OSTraining Makes Pods Framework Video Training Series Available for Free</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47885</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/ostraining-makes-pods-framework-video-training-series-available-for-free</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-40653&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg?resize=628%2C290&quot; alt=&quot;pods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/&quot;&gt;OSTraining&lt;/a&gt;, a site that offers video training for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and other technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/blog/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;http://pods.io/&quot;&gt;Pods Framework&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;training series&lt;/a&gt; is now available for free. Steve Burge, founder of OSTraining.com, says offering the video series for free is the result of a partnership with the Pods Framework project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This project came about because the OSTraining and Pods teams bumped into each other on a regular basis. I often ran into Jim True and Josh Pollock from Pods. We met at WordCamps and WordPress meetups in Tampa, Orlando, and Miami, FL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Pods team explained that they were working on improving their documentation. They started a YouTube series, wrote tutorials, and started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/pods-lead-developer-scott-kingsley-clark-launches-friends-of-pods-funding-campaign&quot;&gt;Friends of Pods&lt;/a&gt; initiative to support their efforts. Making the videos free is our way of contributing to the Pods project,&amp;#8221; Burge told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burge recorded the series after using Pods to create the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appalachiantrail.com/&quot;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt; website. The series provides an introduction to Pods, templates, creating a custom taxonomy, and more. Those interested can view the series on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;OSTraining.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk9dCVMQRmSptuJ6YdVzMkr5&amp;v=4rm95kNxRXg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a look at the first video in the series which introduces viewers to the Pods Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was created in 2014, the series contains great insight into the project and provides an educational foundation for learning Pods 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Request: Alex King Rememberances</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=22017</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear WordPress community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apologies for the selfish and personal nature of this post. I hope you will forgive me given the circumstances. As most of you know, I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as &amp;#8220;dad&amp;#8221;, but when she gets older she&amp;#8217;ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent more than a decade in the WordPress community and I&amp;#8217;d like to request that you to share a few thoughts or remembrances about me that we can compile and share with her when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have crossed paths or if I have managed to do something that you found helpful, I&amp;#8217;d love it if you would take a few minutes to write it down and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/contact&quot;&gt;send it to me&lt;/a&gt; or my wife: heatherkingcom@gmail.com. If you&amp;#8217;re willing to have the story shared publicly, please indicate that accordingly. By default, we will keep everything confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the thread: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; an ongoing story on this site. View the thread timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Step Up Your Game: How to Work With Successful WordPress Clients</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47868</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/step-up-your-game-how-to-work-with-successful-wordpress-clients</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47869&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Mario Y. Peshev&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Ryan Hellyer&quot; href=&quot;http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mario Peshev&lt;/a&gt;. Mario is the founder and WordPress Architect at &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/p9TnMSFMi2&quot;&gt;DevriX&lt;/a&gt; building and maintaining large WordPress-driven platforms. With over 10,000 hours of consulting and training, Mario&amp;#8217;s Yin and Yang is his Open Source advocacy and business growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning &amp;#8211; Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47879&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png?resize=682%2C281&quot; alt=&quot;Step up your game featured image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58522126@N00/430932479&quot;&gt;Stairwell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a learnaholic for as long as I can remember and when I read the aforementioned quote, it resonates strongly with me. My prelude to WordPress years ago was one of the steps toward improvement and success and I’ve developed a special love-hate relationship with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utmost admiration about its influence over the world in terms of Open Source and opportunities for various people in different niches, and its plague of being diminished and depreciated by professional developers and successful businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to solve these issues as long as the inner circle works towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are happy building lego type websites with random ThemeForest themes and you see that as your future, this post is not for you. If you love doing the same repeatedly for mom and pop shops, this may not resonate with you. This is applicable to people who want to get better at what they do, be more professional, and make some impact by solving complex problems for larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress For a Better Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, I presented at a conference focused on kids and teenagers to motivate them, prepare them for the adult life, and nurture their creativity. Kids these days hardly think about their future, between their teenage emotional dramas and boring homework assignments. If you think about it, how can they be passionate about becoming someone if they have no real idea what they need to know and do on a daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used WordPress as an example of a platform that children can use, one that provides them with the opportunity to develop a talent or passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using WordPress for homework and general notes (or a diary) could indicate interest in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young bloggers can potentially do creative writing or copywriting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly switching themes and playing with colors might open the room to design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding plugins and trying to implement complex combinations is the first step to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing posts, looking at analytics and comparing different titles or photos is the way to marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other potential areas of course, but as long as kids can associate with an activity, become passionate about it, and start digging into it, they can save years of slacking, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars on college degrees for specialties they couldn’t care less about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why more and more people join the WordPress industry and switch boring jobs in order to make a living off of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Types Of WordPress Services Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of opportunities for WordPress work is incredible but the vast pool of WordPress jobs is so vague and blurry, that hiring and educating talent is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep an eye on dozens of job boards, portals, and freelance networks. Clients look for Virtual Assistants to get their websites built. They look for expert WordPress developers to apply content changes to their site or web designers to develop complex plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis I see references to WordPress administrators, programmers, developers, designers, marketers, digital artists, webmasters, VAs, and plenty of other job titles used improperly. As a matter of fact, I’m now fascinated when I see a WordPress related job post or an offer looking for the right type of candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news is that you can do anything with WordPress. The caveat here is that WordPress itself is not a skill. You don’t ask for an Internet expert nowadays and you don’t go to the same doctor when you have a headache or you’ve injured your leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide industry of innocent clients and amateur service providers have made it nearly impossible to tell a developer from a marketer, or from a general user who has installed WordPress with an auto-installer twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Indecent World of WordPress Experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-39089&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Job Titles Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/5565517971&quot;&gt;I love &amp;#8217;84&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a lot about impostor syndrome in several reputable WordPress blogs, and people keep identifying themselves in the comments. In my opinion, this is a problem so insignificant as compared to the ever-growing pool of people claiming to be WordPress Experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last several years, I’ve interacted with people all around the world working with WordPress. From freelancers to successful business owners at conferences, and from beginner virtual assistants to full-stack consultants in social media, blogs and job networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of service providers that I’ve found is the one of &lt;em&gt;WordPress experts&lt;/em&gt;. You can easily substitute expert with specialist, guru, master, ninja and rockstar. Just open a new tab and do a few quick searches in Google, job networks, social media and view the large number of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list are &lt;em&gt;WordPress developers&lt;/em&gt;. A WordPress developer is often described as people who install plugins. There are various possible scenarios, but this is rarely the definition of an actual developer proficient in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some boards or blogs list specific skills that let you filter by programming language or a separate tool. My latest research with 200 contractors with WordPress developer titles led to 170 people who rate themselves with 4 or 5 out of 5 stars in PHP proficiency, and 30 with 3 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 170 people in the first group, 150 were college students, Internet marketers, VAs, and people who have substituted strings in WordPress themes thanks to support forums or help from the Codex. Not a single line of code was written from scratch, let alone building anything, and 4 out of 5 or higher self-assessed their level of PHP experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom McFarlin &lt;a href=&quot;http://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-developers-programmer-implementer/&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the difference between a developer and implementer and I wrote an overview defining &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-job-titles-dont-mean-much-anymore&quot;&gt;various technical skills in the WordPress context&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the lack of proper training, any official educational resource or meaningful set of skills per role, both finding talent and improving one’s skills is being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge you to interview several successful clients around you who looked for skillful WordPress folks. They either happened to know the right people, were recommended someone, ended up with several freelancers who messed up big time, went AWOL and suddenly took the cash and disappeared, couldn’t deliver, or they did and the site is incredibly slow and/or got hacked soon thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s sending serious businesses away and I won’t touch the topic of under pricing services and products which brings the quality and support way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivates people to use a reliable resource in order to grow? The WordPress Foundation, nor any of the big players provide official training curriculum, and a definition for formal roles. There is no WordPress certification program (I won’t get into that to avoid unnecessary discussions), and there are no clear paths for requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WordPress Community is Filled with Amateurs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, our community is a large group mostly composed of amateurs who started using WordPress one way or another. These people started earning money and reached a point where they don’t know where they stand, what they’re proficient in, if they’re doing fine, whether they’re experts, impostors, or somewhere in the middle, and what would be helpful to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still use FTP and work with PHP 5.2-supported hosts. The most popular theme marketplaces provide products with broken and inconsistent code. The WordPress.org plugin repository accepts plenty of plugins with suspicious consistency and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these issues are recognized publicly in the WordPress community. Some hosts prohibit SSH and allow solely FTP. PHP 5.2 will be supported by Core for a while, which doesn’t motivate hosts to upgrade. Marketplaces earn millions from their top sellers, so they’re not interested in quickly bringing up quality as long as poorly coded themes sell well. There’s also no formal constantly reviewed plugin repository for high quality plugins and no one is actively backing this idea up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the last paragraph as a rant, it’s because it is. It’s meant to be a “wake up call” to clients who don’t know better and service providers who want to become better. While the WordPress Core itself is incredibly stable and flexible, the rest of the infrastructure is mostly poorly coded due to under pricing, lack of skills, and lack of more successful clients interested in backing up WordPress teams and consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of people and plenty of applications of WordPress. Whatever you do, it’s your professional duty to offer the right type of service instead of misleading your clients, and be aware of the other pertinent verticals. Moreover, it’s the only way forward working with reputable organizations and large profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a Successful Client?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-32204&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png?resize=636%2C278&quot; alt=&quot;Success Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeveeaar/2035597695/&quot;&gt;seeveeaar&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige Conference&lt;/a&gt; happened a few weeks ago, and Shane Pearlman from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tri.be/&quot;&gt;Modern Tribe&lt;/a&gt; shared his experience in a presentation entitled, Land the Big Fish: Strategies Acquiring Larger Clients. It’s a motivational talk that outlines different strategies on negotiating and landing larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the session, Pearlman is asked, “What’s in it for me to go through all of that headache to procure bigger brand names?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated at the beginning, working with successful clients is not for everyone. Some people are afraid to leave their comfort zone. Others are too lazy to learn new skills or sometimes doing the same thing repeatedly may be their perfect job. For every other entrepreneur or business player, successful clients are exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each small change is magnified when working with successful clients. Usually, they have a lot of employees, a solid budget for marketing and advertising, a lot of traffic, and various complex requirements that help them attract more leads or automate their processes. T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hey are often respectable and have access to more capital. This allows them to invest more since their return of investment is worth it; while taking a risk due to saving a few bucks could very well ruin their reputation and harm their business. There are several examples of products or companies in the WordPress community that were hacked or where updates caused major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with successful clients is extremely rewarding and exciting, but getting there requires ace skills and solid experience, as well as the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Target Successful Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience with banks, telecoms, automotive, airline brands, large educational institutions and media outlets over the last 12 years as a developer and a technical lead, there are several specific areas where courageous WordPress freelancers and small business owners can focus on if they are aiming for growth and successful clients, but aren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have identified some steps for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/08/8-steps-to-move-from-freelancer-to-successful-company/&quot;&gt;moving from a freelancer to a successful company&lt;/a&gt;. Here is what we should focus on in the WordPress context in order to step up our game, understand our industry better, and start acting professionally if we want to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress is a Vague Term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a WordPress Expert says nothing. You may be a lead developer of WordPress or someone who can memorize the order of all submenus under Settings in the admin dashboard. Both are classified as WordPress experts and that’s what many people don’t realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialize in a given niche and polish your skills. Focus on a specific group of projects &amp;#8211; membership websites, eCommerce stores, multisite installs. Become a know-it-all professional for an extensible plugin such as, BuddyPress, Gravity Forms, or Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the value you are providing and what it corresponds to. Be respectful to the broad community of professionals in your area, learn from them, ask them to be your mentors. Even the best athletes and CEOs have coaches, business mentors, and boards of directors. Find out what it is that you do whether it’s design, development, marketing, or something else and learn the skill inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Installments Don’t Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people offer WordPress services as an add-on to their portfolio of other services without realizing the impact it has on the business. While WordPress is used for plenty of purposes, it’s still a technical platform that comes with its own specific set of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what will happen if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a vulnerable plugin that is exploited and your client’s password is stolen, along with their private details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You forget to protect the media uploader and the client uploads sensitive data. Scanned images of contracts and ID cards end up in the public space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your sitemap plugin indexes protected data since you used a plugin that doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a site and sell it to a client, and due to the terrible choice of plugins, the site crashes miserably and kills the server during a demonstration in front of their big clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a small list of what ifs, but they happen all the time. If you don’t possess the skills or offer the wrong service, this could damage your client’s business. Upping your game and providing solutions instead of websites allows you to take care of the infrastructure, maintenance work, support, development, security, marketing of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, be aware of the consequences and partner up with other agencies and consultants. Complete packages are what successful clients look for and inexperienced people often mess up what others have built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Expert Skills Won’t Cut It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients look for professional skills. They have real problems that can’t be solved with yet another plugin, and they are smart enough to know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the business of configuring themes and installing a few plugins for clients, that won’t do it for successful customers. You need to specialize in code, design, user experience, marketing, or something else that brings real value to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large clients are looking for state of the art designs, performant and secure code, brilliant marketing skills, and growth hacking strategy. Large clients are successful because they are outstanding at what they do, the services they offer, and they appreciate high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context-Specific WordPress Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations take their marketing presence and technical stack seriously. They carefully delegate based on multiple factors. Being in a meeting with a large client typically means discussing a use case together with several people such as, a creative director, VP of marketing, network engineer, and project manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being skillful in your niche and ready to provide value, you have to learn the business processes of your target client. Your idea of a solution may be applicable for small sites, but it may very well be a bad fit based on the company policy or the variety of services used by the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, a creative director may require you to prepare your theme to be ADA Section 508 compliant, which is an accessibility standard required by certain organizations. The VP of marketing may ask for a Hubspot integration with Cvent within your website for proper CRM and meeting request management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network engineer could outline that they need to host the solution on-site, and set up a specific set of web application firewalls and internal web server security rules restricting certain process callbacks. The project manager might share a complicated timeline based on the organization load, holiday schedule, decision maker’s availability, conferences, and various deliverables that need to be presented by different people and other third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are things that we’ve been asked for over the past few months. If you are used to working with a specific host using Apache, prepare for writing documentation and shipping to a restricted server running HHVM. If you use a framework that isn’t accessible, you will need to step back, explore the Section 508 standards, and build something compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic solutions are often not the right fit for large clients. But if you’re determined to learn more and become a better professional, that’s the perfect challenge for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solving More Complex Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to adjust to different environments, working with large clients means solving more complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a mom and pop shop is somewhat broken or down, it’s probably not a big deal if their site receives 100 visits per month. But for a project with tens of millions of views a month and thousands of concurrent users, it is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on larger and heavy platforms often means dealing with a lot of data, complex relationships, and solid traffic. This means that every single line of your code and business decision will inevitably impact the entire system in a way visible to hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to cope with these, you should study your specialty in detail and understand what the impact is of every single change. These skills increase your value and let you face similar challenges and solve problems that the majority of beginners can’t even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn a lot about the entire stack, and get to know hundreds of different rules. At some point you will voluntarily violate those rules, being aware of the fact that some design patterns and best practices don’t solve specific problems. It’s better to denormalize a database or minify a compression algorithm in order to solve a business problem for a large platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just as they say at a music college &amp;#8211; you learn the music theory for three years, and then you throw everything away and start playing jazz. You need to know the entire architecture and strategy first in order to decide how to optimize it in the best possible manner, whether it’s using a best practice or violating one for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaming Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have worked solo or in a small team, you will eventually need to partner up or grow. Either way, large projects are time consuming and require different expertise, and it’s unthinkable for one to know it all. Therefore, you will work with other professionals from more industries, team up and solve more complex problems together, and learn more about their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have thought about mastering a single skill, teaming up with the right people will add a few more skills as an extra perk, which will increase the potential of your main skill as well. Working with financial analysts on a project for a bank helped me to understand the entire model of loans and mortgages, as well as the internal banking policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to learn how loans and interests work in different cases and get acquainted with standardized security regulations at companies in the financial field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-44224&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png?resize=688%2C368&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Security Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/8264582@N06/3383392046&quot;&gt;Two Locks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy and security are important topics that people often misjudge. Working with large clients means more responsibility and higher impact in case of a problem. In the process of building a solution or consulting a reputable organization, you will most likely have to comply with various security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of them may seem unnecessary, there is a reason they exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better it is for you, your clients, and future endeavors. If you’re not using VPNs, SSH keys, two-factor authentication, or voice recognition IDS, this may be a good lesson for you. Why are they needed, what problems do they solve, and how can you apply them to your personal data and existing set of clients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization and Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47877&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg?resize=620%2C400&quot; alt=&quot;BrainyQuote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BrainyQuote
&lt;p&gt;In order to be helpful to large businesses as a consultant, or an agency, you need to be reliable. This may be a result of a number of testimonials, successful track record at previous companies or a good portfolio. It’s always challenging to start with large customers, so improving your skills and working hard in order to become valuable is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being organized and process-oriented is essential to most reputable organizations. The majority of them are more conservative and operate slowly, since a minor mistake could cost them millions or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rely on detailed specifications, scope of work documents, use case diagrams, UX mockups/wireframes, E/R diagrams, and a large list of documents. They include every single detail in their planning &amp;#8211; from holidays for each member of their team, to different dependencies from other service providers and third-party members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients have managed to build a process and scale it in a way that grows their revenue in a predictable way. In order to be able to handle large projects, you need to treat them as a small project that takes longer to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use a project management system and version control properly, define your pricing strategy, make sure to predict all of the delays for both communication and payments. Learn how large organizations operate and do your due diligence upfront in order to avoid surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take anything for granted and don’t assume anything. The more confident you are, the higher the possibility of making a major mistake. There are always new automatic deployment strategies or a DevOps service you haven’t heard of, another massive CSS3 grid, or a growth hacking strategy that you haven’t explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more challenges you face, the more you’ll learn, and be able to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Personal WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=21662</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/22/personal-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve forked the FavePersonal theme to release a few changes that I&amp;#8217;ve made to it for my own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improved Gallery feature, including support for WordPress shortcode galleries. If you&amp;#8217;re uploading photos directly to your gallery post, you can use drag and drop to set the order for them now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Post Formats admin UI is now responsive and works great on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the Social plugin from the theme (requested by WP.org) &amp;#8211; it can still be installed separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make tons of misc. code changes to match new coding standards vs. previous coding standards (and pass the theme check).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/maine-gallery-510x469.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gallery&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-22028&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally hoping to have the modified theme hosted on WordPress.org but after weeks of waiting for review, they responded that features of the theme like &lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24520#comment:4&quot;&gt;choosing colors and post formats&lt;/a&gt; should be done in separate plugins instead. This makes no sense to me as these are core features of the theme, but happily there are great places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that will host the project for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Personal theme is quite assuredly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?url=alexking.org&quot;&gt;mobile-friendly&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it a great fit for the importance Google&amp;#8217;s is placing on mobile-friendly sites lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub or, for you technically minded, grab the reop with git. Just make sure to also grab the submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:alexkingorg/wp-personal.git&lt;br /&gt;
cd wp-personal&lt;br /&gt;
git submodule update --init --recursive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/project/personal&quot;&gt;Personal Theme&lt;/a&gt;. View the project timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
