<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.3 make it even easier to format your content and customize your site.</p>
<p><iframe width='692' height='389' src='https://videopress.com/embed/T54Iy7Tw?hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1435166243'></script></p>
<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.3:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 2 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Site icons for all</em><br />
<em>Live preview menu changes</em><br />
<em>Four three beta now</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.2 is now available. This is a <strong>critical security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>Version 4.2.2 addresses two security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Genericons icon font package, which is used in a number of popular themes and plugins, contained an HTML file vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. All affected themes and plugins hosted on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> (including the Twenty Fifteen default theme) have been updated today by the WordPress security team to address this issue by removing this nonessential file. To help protect other Genericons usage, WordPress 4.2.2 proactively scans the wp-content directory for this HTML file and removes it. Reported by Robert Abela of <a href="http://netsparker.com">Netsparker</a>.</li>
<li>WordPress versions 4.2 and earlier are affected by a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/">critical cross-site scripting vulnerability</a>, which could enable anonymous users to compromise a site. WordPress 4.2.2 includes a comprehensive fix for this issue. Reported separately by Rice Adu and Tong Shi from Baidu[X-team].</li>
</ul>
<p>The release also includes hardening for a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability when using the visual editor. This issue was reported by Mahadev Subedi.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.2 also contains fixes for 13 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.2">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=32418&amp;stop_rev=32324">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.2</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.2.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.2:</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.3 make it even easier to format your content and customize your site.</p>
<p><iframe width='692' height='389' src='https://videopress.com/embed/T54Iy7Tw?hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1435166243'></script></p>
<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>The Team</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.3:</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.2 is now available. This is a <strong>critical security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>Version 4.2.2 addresses two security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Genericons icon font package, which is used in a number of popular themes and plugins, contained an HTML file vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. All affected themes and plugins hosted on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> (including the Twenty Fifteen default theme) have been updated today by the WordPress security team to address this issue by removing this nonessential file. To help protect other Genericons usage, WordPress 4.2.2 proactively scans the wp-content directory for this HTML file and removes it. Reported by Robert Abela of <a href="http://netsparker.com">Netsparker</a>.</li>
<li>WordPress versions 4.2 and earlier are affected by a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/">critical cross-site scripting vulnerability</a>, which could enable anonymous users to compromise a site. WordPress 4.2.2 includes a comprehensive fix for this issue. Reported separately by Rice Adu and Tong Shi from Baidu[X-team].</li>
</ul>
<p>The release also includes hardening for a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability when using the visual editor. This issue was reported by Mahadev Subedi.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.2 also contains fixes for 13 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.2">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=32418&amp;stop_rev=32324">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.2</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.2.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.2:</p>

	<title>Post Status: A Day of REST — a conference devoted to the WordPress REST API</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14173</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/a-day-of-rest-a-conference-devoted-to-the-wordpress-rest-api/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;A Day of REST&lt;/a&gt; will be the first ever event dedicated to the WordPress REST API. It&amp;#8217;ll happen on January 28th 2016, with a follow-on hack day on the 29th, and will be held at Bishopsgate Institute in London, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is aimed at developers who want to learn how to interact with the new WordPress REST API. From WordPress developers to Javascript developers, to application developers, A Day of REST promises to provide in-depth information that covers every aspect of the WordPress REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of event I&amp;#8217;ve been hoping to see in the WordPress community. Sessions will vary from an introduction to the WordPress REST API to in-depth case studies and guides on utilizing it in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an incredible and rare opportunity to learn from the people making the API and those extending it further than anyone else. A niche event to be sure, A Day of REST  is a big bet on the WordPress REST API &amp;#8212; which is not yet slated for core, but is widely expected to make it to core in the next few releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference is being organized to supply a clear demand for more information, resources, and education on the subject. At most WordCamps, REST API sessions seem to be some of the most crowded, with the most engaged and curious audiences. A Day of REST will be like those sessions, but much bigger, as the entire day will be dedicated to the single topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is speaking at A Day of REST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14179&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/speakers-day-of-rest-752x603.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;speakers-day-of-rest&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker roster consists of people who are building the WordPress REST API, and those who are already using it for production applications and websites. The speakers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan McCue &amp;#8211;  WordPress REST API co-lead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Hoyle &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Bachhuber &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen Vignos &amp;#8211; Director of Engineering, WIRED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K. Adam White &amp;#8211; Open Web Engineer, Bocoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Lenox &amp;#8211; Design Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Taylor &amp;#8211; Senior Engineer, New York Times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski &amp;#8211; Meta Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post Status will be an official partner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really pleased that Post Status will be the official content partner for A Day of REST. That means I’ll be attending the event, and I&amp;#8217;ll offer a number of in-depth posts related to the WordPress REST API, the sessions, interviews, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll also manage content for some of the larger event announcements, like this one. I&amp;#8217;ve known the organizers for a long time, and they are big supporters of Post Status. A Day of REST offers a really great opportunity for me to work with them and offer my readers some unique privileges and exclusive content for a subject that&amp;#8217;s of interest to most of my audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So who is organizing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14180&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/humans-752x333.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;humans&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/organizations/human-made/&quot;&gt;Human Made&lt;/a&gt;, who’ve brought on board &lt;a href=&quot;http://siobhanmckeown.com/about/&quot;&gt;Siobhan McKeown&lt;/a&gt; to lead the charge putting the event together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Made uses the API in a good bit of their services and product work, are really interested to see more adoption of the API, and are eager to provide education resources so that can happen. Those of you who pay close attention may know that two of Human Made&amp;#8217;s own are actually part of the team of four that does much of the REST API development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rmccue&quot;&gt;Ryan McCue&lt;/a&gt; is the project co-lead, and is generally steering the ship; the API started as his GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle&quot;&gt;Joe Hoyle&lt;/a&gt; is in day to day conversations for project direction and also commits a lot of code to the API; he is a co-founder of Human Made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hack Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 29th January 2016, there will be a WordPress REST API hack day. This event is being hosted by Mozilla Spaces in London. Space for the hack day is limited but the team would love for anyone interested to come along and help make the WordPress REST API. Bring a laptop and expect to get hacking. This event will be for building the REST API specifically, and not geared toward other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ticket details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/tickets/&quot;&gt;from the website&lt;/a&gt;. They’re £125 (+ VAT &amp;amp; booking fees) &amp;#8212; which ends up being around $235 US &amp;#8212; and the price includes all of the usual conference goodies: presentations, lunch, swag, and an informal afterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confirmed sponsors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is excited to already have some awesome sponsors on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prospress.com/&quot;&gt;ProsPress&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sucuri.net/&quot;&gt;Sucuri&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is also looking for more sponsors to get involved and help make this unique event happen. If you’d like to sponsor, send an email to events@humanmade.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the content, you can get updates either from this blog, or from the A Day of REST website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;feelingrestful.com&lt;/a&gt;. You should also follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/feelingrestful&quot;&gt;@feelingrestful&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for live updates. I&amp;#8217;ll have in-depth content and broader event information and the event site will have more general announcements, news, and event updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is quite accessible from much of the world, so I am hopeful and confident that there will be a diverse audience in attendance. I certainly look forward to visiting; and I was pleasantly surprised that it doesn&amp;#8217;t get as cold there as I thought; January temperatures (lows and highs) stay around the 40s (F, or 5-9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_default&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_unit_c&quot;&gt;°&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; C) &amp;#8212; which is likely warmer than it&amp;#8217;ll be where I live in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is an exciting development in the WordPress conference ecosystem and I&amp;#8217;m confident it&amp;#8217;s going to be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In August of 2014, Envato &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/news/item-support-sustainability-authors-clarity-buyers/&quot;&gt;announced a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; that would allow sellers on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codecanyon.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;CodeCanyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;ThemeForest&lt;/a&gt; to inform buyers whether or not an item is supported. Earlier today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/releases/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/&quot;&gt;Envato implemented&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;Item Support Policy&lt;/a&gt; for sellers on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When browsing items on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, a blue badge indicates the seller provides support. There&amp;#8217;s also a badge and text that informs potential buyers if an item is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47991&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png?resize=639%2C408&quot; alt=&quot;This Item is Supported&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This Item is Supported
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt;, buyers automatically receive six months of support from the date of purchase. If you need support for an entire year, you can buy an extension for a nominal upgrade fee. Envato takes 30% and gives 70% of the purchase to authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of a &lt;b&gt;6-month support extension&lt;/b&gt; for a &lt;b&gt;Regular License&lt;/b&gt; is calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37.5% of the item price (30% of the list price) when purchased at the same time as the license;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;62.5% of the item price (50% of the list price) when purchased during the support period; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87.5% of the item price (70% of the list price) when purchased after the support period has ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Freeman, product manager for Envato, says the changes provide a standardized definition of support, &amp;#8220;Buyers will know exactly what to expect from all purchases on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers who purchased supported items before the new policy went into effect have six months of free tech support starting on September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disgruntled Authors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.envato.com/t/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/3619&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; with over 165 responses, sellers discussed the pros and cons of the policy while some expressed anger. &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/user/jonathan01&quot;&gt;Jonathan Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr3ativ.com/&quot;&gt;Cr3ativ&lt;/a&gt;, who sells several items on ThemeForest, thinks the policy is not as good as alternatives offered outside of the marketplaces because of its confusing complexity for both authors and buyers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure why Envato chose this solution when we already have a well established support/upgrade system in place within most of the WordPress community where 12 months of support is included in the purchase and customers receive a 50% discount to continue receiving support and updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is a work in progress, &amp;#8220;We will be monitoring the impacts of this change very closely and will be tweaking, improving and enhancing the support tools over coming weeks and months,&amp;#8221; Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a buyer or seller on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, let us know what you think of the support policy in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Twenty Sixteen Now Available on GitHub and the WordPress Theme Directory</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47973</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/twenty-sixteen-now-available-on-github-and-the-wordpress-theme-directory</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen, the default theme scheduled to ship with WordPress 4.4, is available for download on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/&quot;&gt;WordPress theme directory&lt;/a&gt;. According &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/29/twenty-sixteen-is-now-on-github/&quot;&gt;to Tammie Lister&lt;/a&gt;, Twenty Sixteen will be developed as if it were a feature plugin and will merge into WordPress core later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development takes place on GitHub, changes will regularly sync up to the WordPress theme directory. By installing and activating Twenty Sixteen from the theme directory, users can easily update to new versions as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Twenty Sixteen has 23 issues and 27 pull requests on GitHub. Many of the issues such as, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/pull/23&quot;&gt;introducing automated Travis CI build testing into Twenty Sixteen,&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/labels/discussion&quot;&gt;up for discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the top half of the Tavern looks like with Twenty Sixteen activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47974&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=1025%2C563&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the content section looks like. Notice the block of code that displays instead of an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47976&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=881%2C648&quot; alt=&quot;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen Activated
&lt;p&gt;Testers are encouraged to open issues and pull requests on GitHub. If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with how GitHub works, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; explains how to contribute to the Twenty Sixteen project. Keep in mind that Twenty Sixteen is a work in progress and should not be used in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress.com Unveils the Action Bar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47954</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-unveils-the-action-bar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/new-action-bar/&quot;&gt;unveiled a new user interface&lt;/a&gt; called the Action Bar. It&amp;#8217;s a bar that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen for logged in users and is accessible from any device. The bar performs multiple tasks depending on the page you&amp;#8217;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47955&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png?resize=1025%2C627&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Action Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress Action Bar
&lt;p&gt;When on a WordPress.com powered site that you&amp;#8217;re not following, the bar turns into a Follow button. Clicking the follow button will notify you of new posts published on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47956&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png?resize=192%2C60&quot; alt=&quot;Action Bar Follow Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Action Bar Follow Button
&lt;p&gt;If you click the three dots to the right, you&amp;#8217;ll see a variety of options depending upon the page you&amp;#8217;re viewing. If it&amp;#8217;s the homepage, you&amp;#8217;ll see links to download the theme the site uses, report the content, or manage the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re browsing a specific post on a WordPress.com site, you&amp;#8217;ll see an additional link to copy a shortlink for quick and easy sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47957&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png?resize=265%2C319&quot; alt=&quot;Easily Share Posts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easily Share Posts
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com and are logged in, the Follow button turns into a Customize button. This link provides a quick way to enter the Customizer. There&amp;#8217;s also an Edit link if you&amp;#8217;re browsing a published post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47958&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png?resize=307%2C348&quot; alt=&quot;Edit and Customize Links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Edit and Customize Links
&lt;p&gt;If the action bar is too big and you want to minimize it, click the three dots and select the option to Collapse the bar. It will shrink the bar into squares and get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the action bar is the ability to quickly see and download a theme used on a WordPress.com site. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for WordPress.com specific sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailypost.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The Daily Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What annoys me about the action bar is that it disappears when I scroll down. I caught myself scrolling down to read a post and when I looked for the edit button to fix a typo, the action bar was gone. I think it should stay on the screen at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to see the Edit link in the action bar open a front-end editor. It&amp;#8217;s time WordPress.com step up its game and stop forcing users through a backend interface to edit published content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the experimental action bar but at the same time, I question the reasoning for adding yet another user interface element to mimic actions already supported by other buttons and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, between the admin bar, dashboard, the edit link underneath a post, and the action bar, there are now four different ways to edit a post. How many roads are necessary to reach the same destination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com, let me know what you think of the action bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.3.3 Patches Security Vulnerabilities in BuddyPress Messages Component</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47948</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-3-patches-security-vulnerabilities-in-buddypress-messages-component</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-41978&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=828%2C265&quot; alt=&quot;BuddyPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3&lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2015/08/buddypress-2-3-3/&quot;&gt; is available&lt;/a&gt; and users are encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;update as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. A few security vulnerabilities were discovered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/buddypress-components-and-features/#internal-messaging&quot;&gt;BuddyPress Messages, &lt;/a&gt;a core component that allows users to send and receive private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to the BuddyPress team that could allow members to manipulate a failed private outbound message and inject unexpected output to the browser. The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof Katowicz-Kowalewski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the first vulnerability, the BuddyPress core development team independently discovered and fixed related vulnerabilities with the messages component that could allow for carefully crafted private message content to be rendered incorrectly to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3 also fixes a couple of bugs in the 2.3 codebase and improves support for backend changes made in WordPress 4.3. To protect your sites from these vulnerabilities, you should perform a full backup and &lt;strong&gt;update BuddyPress as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Theme Review Team Begins Phasing Out Favicon Support</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47940</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-begins-phasing-out-favicon-support</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main features in WordPress 4.3 are Site Icons. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icon&lt;/a&gt; is an image that represents a website across multiple platforms and replaces Favicons. With Site Icons in WordPress core, the WordPress Theme Review team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;phasing out the feature&lt;/a&gt; in existing themes hosted in the theme directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;p&gt;Justin Tadlock, a theme review admin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;published a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to provide a backwards compatible experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tadlock, the easiest method is to check if the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; function exists. This tells you if the user is running WordPress 4.3 and has the site icon feature available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check if the user has set up a new icon using the core WordPress feature by using the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; conditional tag which returns either &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some example code from the tutorial you can use to handle the check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ( ! function_exists( 'has_site_icon' ) || ! has_site_icon() ) {

    // Output old, custom favicon feature.
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional information, I encourage you to read&lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/wordpress/development/backwards-compatibility-site-icons/&quot;&gt; Stephen Cronin&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; which goes into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Theme Review Team enforces a guideline where features added to core are phased out of themes within two major releases. By the time WordPress 4.5 is released, theme authors will be able to remove legacy code without disrupting the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

According to the announcement, the summit is invite only similar to last year’s event at WordCamp San Francisco:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WordPress Community Summit is a smaller, invite-only event for&amp;nbsp;active members and contributors on the many teams that work to improve&amp;nbsp;WordPress: Core, Design, Mobile, Accessibility, Support, Polygots, Documentation, Themes, Plugins, Community, Meta, Training, Flow&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;TV .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey or application form will soon be published which will result in a pool from which the attendees will be invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit is a rare opportunity for members of various contributor teams to focus and work together in the same physical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual WordPress Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use, build, or make a living with WordPress, please take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2015&quot;&gt;annual survey&lt;/a&gt;. Results will be shared during Matt Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation at WordCamp US. The more people who fill out the survey, the more representative the data will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation from 2014 to see results from the previous survey.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Stream Is Shutting Down Its Cloud Data Storage October 1st</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47925</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/stream-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-data-storage-october-1st</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/introducing-stream-3/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt; and includes some significant improvements. Stream is a WordPress plugin that tracks changes to a site similar to an audit trail. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service&quot;&gt;version two was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, it morphed from a plugin to a service. Activity logs were stored in the cloud which lessened the amount of resources used on local webservers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version three will no longer store data in the cloud. Instead, it will store activity logs locally. The cloud service provided by Stream 2 is closing on &lt;strong&gt;October 1st&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives users a little more than a month to migrate data from the cloud to their local webserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cloud is Expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Carbis, lead developer of Stream, says the time frame was chosen based on a number of factors, &amp;#8220;We chose a 6 week migration window as a balance between bleeding cash and doing the right thing by our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s also helpful to remember that the vast majority of our users are on a Free plan, which only includes 12 weeks of storage. We are monitoring the accounts of each of our paid users and I&amp;#8217;m personally making sure that every one of them has migrated,&amp;#8221; Carbis told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move away from the cloud is largely based on cost. The majority of Stream&amp;#8217;s customers signed up to the free plan with a significant lack of interest in the Pro Subscription. Server costs were also higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XWP to The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lack of income from Stream 2 and acquisition talks failing, Carbis was contracted to do outside work leaving Frankie Jarrett the only person working on the project. Stream&amp;#8217;s investor decided to pull the plug on the project at the same time Jarrett decided to resign from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I heard that Frankie had resigned I gave him a call. We reminisced on our achievements, and threw around some of our ideas on what could have been. That conversation renewed my inspiration. I jotted down some notes, and that’s when things started to turn around,&amp;#8221; Carbis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members from &lt;a href=&quot;https://xwp.co/&quot;&gt;XWP&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to lend a helping hand and the project is now officially under the XWP umbrella. This allows Stream to remain free and open source. The partnership will also facilitate add-on, connectors, and adapters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New in Stream 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is rewritten from the ground up. Activity logs use half the space in the database compared to Stream 2. It supports multisite through the use of Network Admin and uses a dependency injection model to be more extendable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Stream 3 includes a variety of improvements two notable features have been removed, Notifications and Reports. If you depend on these features, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/stream-3-faq/&quot;&gt;review the following FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbis and XWP are taking Stream into a new direction. Stream&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wp-stream/roadmap/&quot;&gt;proposed roadmap&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub and Carbis encourages users to not only review it, but to contribute to the project&amp;#8217;s future, &amp;#8220;I’d like to see Stream’s users contribute more to its direction. Contribution isn’t limited to ideas either. If you can design, develop, or translate, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wp-stream/stream&quot;&gt;contributing to the Stream project&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if Stream can regain the momentum it lost after transitioning to a cloud based system to store data. Now that Stream stores activity logs locally again, those in the EU should be able to use it without breaking privacy laws. Stream is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; on the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Akismet: Quantifying Reddit Bigotry</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1859</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/08/27/quantifying-reddit-bigotry/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2015-08-30): It looks like the team who created the tool decided to retire it due to some reported accuracy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never pass on the opportunity to mix in a little bit of humor with our passion for web content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our engineers, Dan Walmsley, participated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedyhackday.org/la-2015&quot;&gt;Cultivated Wit&amp;#8217;s Comedy Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles last weekend, and his team&amp;#8217;s resulting project has since surfaced on &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-tool-quantifies-reddit-bigotry&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/26/reddit-bigotry-check/&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeredditcheck.com/&quot;&gt;Free Reddit Check&lt;/a&gt;, created by Dan&amp;#8217;s team and crowned with the day&amp;#8217;s top prize, is a site which attempts to quantify the terribleness of Reddit users based on their public comment content and subreddit participation. While perfectly suited for a hack day which pairs developers and comedians, there is certainly usefulness in determining the respectability of a potential online acquaintance. Or just knowing who to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being obsessed with content analysis, community moderation, and keeping the web&amp;#8217;s underbelly in check, we can&amp;#8217;t help but think it&amp;#8217;s a nifty idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1859&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: First Look at the Twenty Sixteen Default WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47897</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.4 is the last scheduled major release of the year and with it will come a new default theme to replace Twenty Fifteen. On the Make WordPress Core site, Tammie Lister &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/25/introducing-twenty-sixteen/&quot;&gt;published an image gallery&lt;/a&gt; that shows off the design of Twenty Sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lister, the process of determining the new default theme has taken months, &amp;#8220;Lots of themes were considered, eventually settling on the one you see below. It’s a perfect fit,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47898&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png?resize=433%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen
&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen is designed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi&quot;&gt;Takashi Irie,&lt;/a&gt; who also designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2013/12/13/twenty-fourteen-wordpress-3-8-parker/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fourteen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2015/03/19/twenty-fifteen-the-wordpress-default-theme-for-2015/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; default themes. Irie describes Twenty Sixteen as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modernized approach of an ever-popular layout — a horizontal masthead and an optional right sidebar that works well with both blogs and websites. It has custom color options that allow you to make your own Twenty Sixteen. The theme was designed on a harmonious fluid grid with a mobile first approach. This means it looks great on any device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theme has hints of Twenty Fourteen but is different enough to stand on its own as a unique design. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look as modern as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; out-of-the box but the design could change during the 4.4 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help Twenty Sixteen be the best it can be, please join the weekly meetings held every Monday and Friday at 16:00 UTC in the #core-themes channel on &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt;. The meetings are a half hour-long and start once the theme is initially added to WordPress core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think of Twenty Sixteen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: OSTraining Makes Pods Framework Video Training Series Available for Free</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47885</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/ostraining-makes-pods-framework-video-training-series-available-for-free</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-40653&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg?resize=628%2C290&quot; alt=&quot;pods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/&quot;&gt;OSTraining&lt;/a&gt;, a site that offers video training for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and other technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/blog/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;http://pods.io/&quot;&gt;Pods Framework&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;training series&lt;/a&gt; is now available for free. Steve Burge, founder of OSTraining.com, says offering the video series for free is the result of a partnership with the Pods Framework project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This project came about because the OSTraining and Pods teams bumped into each other on a regular basis. I often ran into Jim True and Josh Pollock from Pods. We met at WordCamps and WordPress meetups in Tampa, Orlando, and Miami, FL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Pods team explained that they were working on improving their documentation. They started a YouTube series, wrote tutorials, and started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/pods-lead-developer-scott-kingsley-clark-launches-friends-of-pods-funding-campaign&quot;&gt;Friends of Pods&lt;/a&gt; initiative to support their efforts. Making the videos free is our way of contributing to the Pods project,&amp;#8221; Burge told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burge recorded the series after using Pods to create the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appalachiantrail.com/&quot;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt; website. The series provides an introduction to Pods, templates, creating a custom taxonomy, and more. Those interested can view the series on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;OSTraining.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk9dCVMQRmSptuJ6YdVzMkr5&amp;v=4rm95kNxRXg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a look at the first video in the series which introduces viewers to the Pods Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was created in 2014, the series contains great insight into the project and provides an educational foundation for learning Pods 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Request: Alex King Rememberances</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=22017</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear WordPress community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apologies for the selfish and personal nature of this post. I hope you will forgive me given the circumstances. As most of you know, I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as &amp;#8220;dad&amp;#8221;, but when she gets older she&amp;#8217;ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent more than a decade in the WordPress community and I&amp;#8217;d like to request that you to share a few thoughts or remembrances about me that we can compile and share with her when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have crossed paths or if I have managed to do something that you found helpful, I&amp;#8217;d love it if you would take a few minutes to write it down and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/contact&quot;&gt;send it to me&lt;/a&gt; or my wife: heatherkingcom@gmail.com. If you&amp;#8217;re willing to have the story shared publicly, please indicate that accordingly. By default, we will keep everything confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the thread: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; an ongoing story on this site. View the thread timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47879&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png?resize=682%2C281&quot; alt=&quot;Step up your game featured image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58522126@N00/430932479&quot;&gt;Stairwell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a learnaholic for as long as I can remember and when I read the aforementioned quote, it resonates strongly with me. My prelude to WordPress years ago was one of the steps toward improvement and success and I’ve developed a special love-hate relationship with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utmost admiration about its influence over the world in terms of Open Source and opportunities for various people in different niches, and its plague of being diminished and depreciated by professional developers and successful businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to solve these issues as long as the inner circle works towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are happy building lego type websites with random ThemeForest themes and you see that as your future, this post is not for you. If you love doing the same repeatedly for mom and pop shops, this may not resonate with you. This is applicable to people who want to get better at what they do, be more professional, and make some impact by solving complex problems for larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress For a Better Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, I presented at a conference focused on kids and teenagers to motivate them, prepare them for the adult life, and nurture their creativity. Kids these days hardly think about their future, between their teenage emotional dramas and boring homework assignments. If you think about it, how can they be passionate about becoming someone if they have no real idea what they need to know and do on a daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used WordPress as an example of a platform that children can use, one that provides them with the opportunity to develop a talent or passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using WordPress for homework and general notes (or a diary) could indicate interest in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young bloggers can potentially do creative writing or copywriting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly switching themes and playing with colors might open the room to design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding plugins and trying to implement complex combinations is the first step to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing posts, looking at analytics and comparing different titles or photos is the way to marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other potential areas of course, but as long as kids can associate with an activity, become passionate about it, and start digging into it, they can save years of slacking, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars on college degrees for specialties they couldn’t care less about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why more and more people join the WordPress industry and switch boring jobs in order to make a living off of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Types Of WordPress Services Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of opportunities for WordPress work is incredible but the vast pool of WordPress jobs is so vague and blurry, that hiring and educating talent is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep an eye on dozens of job boards, portals, and freelance networks. Clients look for Virtual Assistants to get their websites built. They look for expert WordPress developers to apply content changes to their site or web designers to develop complex plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis I see references to WordPress administrators, programmers, developers, designers, marketers, digital artists, webmasters, VAs, and plenty of other job titles used improperly. As a matter of fact, I’m now fascinated when I see a WordPress related job post or an offer looking for the right type of candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news is that you can do anything with WordPress. The caveat here is that WordPress itself is not a skill. You don’t ask for an Internet expert nowadays and you don’t go to the same doctor when you have a headache or you’ve injured your leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide industry of innocent clients and amateur service providers have made it nearly impossible to tell a developer from a marketer, or from a general user who has installed WordPress with an auto-installer twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Indecent World of WordPress Experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-39089&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Job Titles Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/5565517971&quot;&gt;I love &amp;#8217;84&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a lot about impostor syndrome in several reputable WordPress blogs, and people keep identifying themselves in the comments. In my opinion, this is a problem so insignificant as compared to the ever-growing pool of people claiming to be WordPress Experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last several years, I’ve interacted with people all around the world working with WordPress. From freelancers to successful business owners at conferences, and from beginner virtual assistants to full-stack consultants in social media, blogs and job networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of service providers that I’ve found is the one of &lt;em&gt;WordPress experts&lt;/em&gt;. You can easily substitute expert with specialist, guru, master, ninja and rockstar. Just open a new tab and do a few quick searches in Google, job networks, social media and view the large number of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list are &lt;em&gt;WordPress developers&lt;/em&gt;. A WordPress developer is often described as people who install plugins. There are various possible scenarios, but this is rarely the definition of an actual developer proficient in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some boards or blogs list specific skills that let you filter by programming language or a separate tool. My latest research with 200 contractors with WordPress developer titles led to 170 people who rate themselves with 4 or 5 out of 5 stars in PHP proficiency, and 30 with 3 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 170 people in the first group, 150 were college students, Internet marketers, VAs, and people who have substituted strings in WordPress themes thanks to support forums or help from the Codex. Not a single line of code was written from scratch, let alone building anything, and 4 out of 5 or higher self-assessed their level of PHP experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom McFarlin &lt;a href=&quot;http://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-developers-programmer-implementer/&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the difference between a developer and implementer and I wrote an overview defining &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-job-titles-dont-mean-much-anymore&quot;&gt;various technical skills in the WordPress context&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the lack of proper training, any official educational resource or meaningful set of skills per role, both finding talent and improving one’s skills is being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge you to interview several successful clients around you who looked for skillful WordPress folks. They either happened to know the right people, were recommended someone, ended up with several freelancers who messed up big time, went AWOL and suddenly took the cash and disappeared, couldn’t deliver, or they did and the site is incredibly slow and/or got hacked soon thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s sending serious businesses away and I won’t touch the topic of under pricing services and products which brings the quality and support way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivates people to use a reliable resource in order to grow? The WordPress Foundation, nor any of the big players provide official training curriculum, and a definition for formal roles. There is no WordPress certification program (I won’t get into that to avoid unnecessary discussions), and there are no clear paths for requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WordPress Community is Filled with Amateurs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, our community is a large group mostly composed of amateurs who started using WordPress one way or another. These people started earning money and reached a point where they don’t know where they stand, what they’re proficient in, if they’re doing fine, whether they’re experts, impostors, or somewhere in the middle, and what would be helpful to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still use FTP and work with PHP 5.2-supported hosts. The most popular theme marketplaces provide products with broken and inconsistent code. The WordPress.org plugin repository accepts plenty of plugins with suspicious consistency and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these issues are recognized publicly in the WordPress community. Some hosts prohibit SSH and allow solely FTP. PHP 5.2 will be supported by Core for a while, which doesn’t motivate hosts to upgrade. Marketplaces earn millions from their top sellers, so they’re not interested in quickly bringing up quality as long as poorly coded themes sell well. There’s also no formal constantly reviewed plugin repository for high quality plugins and no one is actively backing this idea up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the last paragraph as a rant, it’s because it is. It’s meant to be a “wake up call” to clients who don’t know better and service providers who want to become better. While the WordPress Core itself is incredibly stable and flexible, the rest of the infrastructure is mostly poorly coded due to under pricing, lack of skills, and lack of more successful clients interested in backing up WordPress teams and consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of people and plenty of applications of WordPress. Whatever you do, it’s your professional duty to offer the right type of service instead of misleading your clients, and be aware of the other pertinent verticals. Moreover, it’s the only way forward working with reputable organizations and large profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a Successful Client?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-32204&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png?resize=636%2C278&quot; alt=&quot;Success Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeveeaar/2035597695/&quot;&gt;seeveeaar&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige Conference&lt;/a&gt; happened a few weeks ago, and Shane Pearlman from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tri.be/&quot;&gt;Modern Tribe&lt;/a&gt; shared his experience in a presentation entitled, Land the Big Fish: Strategies Acquiring Larger Clients. It’s a motivational talk that outlines different strategies on negotiating and landing larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the session, Pearlman is asked, “What’s in it for me to go through all of that headache to procure bigger brand names?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated at the beginning, working with successful clients is not for everyone. Some people are afraid to leave their comfort zone. Others are too lazy to learn new skills or sometimes doing the same thing repeatedly may be their perfect job. For every other entrepreneur or business player, successful clients are exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each small change is magnified when working with successful clients. Usually, they have a lot of employees, a solid budget for marketing and advertising, a lot of traffic, and various complex requirements that help them attract more leads or automate their processes. T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hey are often respectable and have access to more capital. This allows them to invest more since their return of investment is worth it; while taking a risk due to saving a few bucks could very well ruin their reputation and harm their business. There are several examples of products or companies in the WordPress community that were hacked or where updates caused major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with successful clients is extremely rewarding and exciting, but getting there requires ace skills and solid experience, as well as the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Target Successful Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience with banks, telecoms, automotive, airline brands, large educational institutions and media outlets over the last 12 years as a developer and a technical lead, there are several specific areas where courageous WordPress freelancers and small business owners can focus on if they are aiming for growth and successful clients, but aren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have identified some steps for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/08/8-steps-to-move-from-freelancer-to-successful-company/&quot;&gt;moving from a freelancer to a successful company&lt;/a&gt;. Here is what we should focus on in the WordPress context in order to step up our game, understand our industry better, and start acting professionally if we want to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress is a Vague Term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a WordPress Expert says nothing. You may be a lead developer of WordPress or someone who can memorize the order of all submenus under Settings in the admin dashboard. Both are classified as WordPress experts and that’s what many people don’t realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialize in a given niche and polish your skills. Focus on a specific group of projects &amp;#8211; membership websites, eCommerce stores, multisite installs. Become a know-it-all professional for an extensible plugin such as, BuddyPress, Gravity Forms, or Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the value you are providing and what it corresponds to. Be respectful to the broad community of professionals in your area, learn from them, ask them to be your mentors. Even the best athletes and CEOs have coaches, business mentors, and boards of directors. Find out what it is that you do whether it’s design, development, marketing, or something else and learn the skill inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Installments Don’t Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people offer WordPress services as an add-on to their portfolio of other services without realizing the impact it has on the business. While WordPress is used for plenty of purposes, it’s still a technical platform that comes with its own specific set of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what will happen if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a vulnerable plugin that is exploited and your client’s password is stolen, along with their private details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You forget to protect the media uploader and the client uploads sensitive data. Scanned images of contracts and ID cards end up in the public space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your sitemap plugin indexes protected data since you used a plugin that doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a site and sell it to a client, and due to the terrible choice of plugins, the site crashes miserably and kills the server during a demonstration in front of their big clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a small list of what ifs, but they happen all the time. If you don’t possess the skills or offer the wrong service, this could damage your client’s business. Upping your game and providing solutions instead of websites allows you to take care of the infrastructure, maintenance work, support, development, security, marketing of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, be aware of the consequences and partner up with other agencies and consultants. Complete packages are what successful clients look for and inexperienced people often mess up what others have built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Expert Skills Won’t Cut It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients look for professional skills. They have real problems that can’t be solved with yet another plugin, and they are smart enough to know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the business of configuring themes and installing a few plugins for clients, that won’t do it for successful customers. You need to specialize in code, design, user experience, marketing, or something else that brings real value to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large clients are looking for state of the art designs, performant and secure code, brilliant marketing skills, and growth hacking strategy. Large clients are successful because they are outstanding at what they do, the services they offer, and they appreciate high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context-Specific WordPress Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations take their marketing presence and technical stack seriously. They carefully delegate based on multiple factors. Being in a meeting with a large client typically means discussing a use case together with several people such as, a creative director, VP of marketing, network engineer, and project manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being skillful in your niche and ready to provide value, you have to learn the business processes of your target client. Your idea of a solution may be applicable for small sites, but it may very well be a bad fit based on the company policy or the variety of services used by the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, a creative director may require you to prepare your theme to be ADA Section 508 compliant, which is an accessibility standard required by certain organizations. The VP of marketing may ask for a Hubspot integration with Cvent within your website for proper CRM and meeting request management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network engineer could outline that they need to host the solution on-site, and set up a specific set of web application firewalls and internal web server security rules restricting certain process callbacks. The project manager might share a complicated timeline based on the organization load, holiday schedule, decision maker’s availability, conferences, and various deliverables that need to be presented by different people and other third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are things that we’ve been asked for over the past few months. If you are used to working with a specific host using Apache, prepare for writing documentation and shipping to a restricted server running HHVM. If you use a framework that isn’t accessible, you will need to step back, explore the Section 508 standards, and build something compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic solutions are often not the right fit for large clients. But if you’re determined to learn more and become a better professional, that’s the perfect challenge for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solving More Complex Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to adjust to different environments, working with large clients means solving more complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a mom and pop shop is somewhat broken or down, it’s probably not a big deal if their site receives 100 visits per month. But for a project with tens of millions of views a month and thousands of concurrent users, it is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on larger and heavy platforms often means dealing with a lot of data, complex relationships, and solid traffic. This means that every single line of your code and business decision will inevitably impact the entire system in a way visible to hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to cope with these, you should study your specialty in detail and understand what the impact is of every single change. These skills increase your value and let you face similar challenges and solve problems that the majority of beginners can’t even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn a lot about the entire stack, and get to know hundreds of different rules. At some point you will voluntarily violate those rules, being aware of the fact that some design patterns and best practices don’t solve specific problems. It’s better to denormalize a database or minify a compression algorithm in order to solve a business problem for a large platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just as they say at a music college &amp;#8211; you learn the music theory for three years, and then you throw everything away and start playing jazz. You need to know the entire architecture and strategy first in order to decide how to optimize it in the best possible manner, whether it’s using a best practice or violating one for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaming Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have worked solo or in a small team, you will eventually need to partner up or grow. Either way, large projects are time consuming and require different expertise, and it’s unthinkable for one to know it all. Therefore, you will work with other professionals from more industries, team up and solve more complex problems together, and learn more about their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have thought about mastering a single skill, teaming up with the right people will add a few more skills as an extra perk, which will increase the potential of your main skill as well. Working with financial analysts on a project for a bank helped me to understand the entire model of loans and mortgages, as well as the internal banking policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to learn how loans and interests work in different cases and get acquainted with standardized security regulations at companies in the financial field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-44224&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png?resize=688%2C368&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Security Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/8264582@N06/3383392046&quot;&gt;Two Locks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy and security are important topics that people often misjudge. Working with large clients means more responsibility and higher impact in case of a problem. In the process of building a solution or consulting a reputable organization, you will most likely have to comply with various security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of them may seem unnecessary, there is a reason they exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better it is for you, your clients, and future endeavors. If you’re not using VPNs, SSH keys, two-factor authentication, or voice recognition IDS, this may be a good lesson for you. Why are they needed, what problems do they solve, and how can you apply them to your personal data and existing set of clients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization and Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47877&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg?resize=620%2C400&quot; alt=&quot;BrainyQuote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BrainyQuote
&lt;p&gt;In order to be helpful to large businesses as a consultant, or an agency, you need to be reliable. This may be a result of a number of testimonials, successful track record at previous companies or a good portfolio. It’s always challenging to start with large customers, so improving your skills and working hard in order to become valuable is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being organized and process-oriented is essential to most reputable organizations. The majority of them are more conservative and operate slowly, since a minor mistake could cost them millions or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rely on detailed specifications, scope of work documents, use case diagrams, UX mockups/wireframes, E/R diagrams, and a large list of documents. They include every single detail in their planning &amp;#8211; from holidays for each member of their team, to different dependencies from other service providers and third-party members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients have managed to build a process and scale it in a way that grows their revenue in a predictable way. In order to be able to handle large projects, you need to treat them as a small project that takes longer to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use a project management system and version control properly, define your pricing strategy, make sure to predict all of the delays for both communication and payments. Learn how large organizations operate and do your due diligence upfront in order to avoid surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take anything for granted and don’t assume anything. The more confident you are, the higher the possibility of making a major mistake. There are always new automatic deployment strategies or a DevOps service you haven’t heard of, another massive CSS3 grid, or a growth hacking strategy that you haven’t explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more challenges you face, the more you’ll learn, and be able to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Personal WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=21662</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/22/personal-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve forked the FavePersonal theme to release a few changes that I&amp;#8217;ve made to it for my own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improved Gallery feature, including support for WordPress shortcode galleries. If you&amp;#8217;re uploading photos directly to your gallery post, you can use drag and drop to set the order for them now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Post Formats admin UI is now responsive and works great on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the Social plugin from the theme (requested by WP.org) &amp;#8211; it can still be installed separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make tons of misc. code changes to match new coding standards vs. previous coding standards (and pass the theme check).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/maine-gallery-510x469.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gallery&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-22028&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally hoping to have the modified theme hosted on WordPress.org but after weeks of waiting for review, they responded that features of the theme like &lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24520#comment:4&quot;&gt;choosing colors and post formats&lt;/a&gt; should be done in separate plugins instead. This makes no sense to me as these are core features of the theme, but happily there are great places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that will host the project for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Personal theme is quite assuredly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?url=alexking.org&quot;&gt;mobile-friendly&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it a great fit for the importance Google&amp;#8217;s is placing on mobile-friendly sites lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub or, for you technically minded, grab the reop with git. Just make sure to also grab the submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:alexkingorg/wp-personal.git&lt;br /&gt;
cd wp-personal&lt;br /&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: WordCampus a Conference Devoted to Using WordPress in Higher Education</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47853</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordcampus-a-conference-devoted-to-using-wordpress-in-higher-education</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Higher education is a subject that &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.tv/?s=education&quot;&gt;some WordCamps&lt;/a&gt; have tackled over the years, but what if there was an event entirely devoted to it? That&amp;#8217;s the idea &lt;a href=&quot;http://bamadesigner.com&quot;&gt;Rachel Carden&lt;/a&gt; is proposing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;. The idea started off as a tweet but quickly gained momentum with others in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ooh. Dream with me: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampus?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;: A WordCamp for folks using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordPress&lt;/a&gt; in Higher Education.&quot; I like it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/heweb?src=hash&quot;&gt;#heweb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&quot;&gt;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rachel Carden (@bamadesigner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/628324358126235648&quot;&gt;August 3, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCampus is an event that would cover topics such as, how to manage a large-scale network of faculty blogs, abiding by FERPA regulations, or how to best implement single sign-on that integrates with Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carden &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-ed-conference-wordcampus/&quot;&gt;outlines her idea in detail&lt;/a&gt; on Post Status and says that even though camp is in the event&amp;#8217;s name, it doesn&amp;#8217;t imply that it would be an official WordCamp event. She&amp;#8217;s also open to organizing an event not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in speaking, sponsoring, or attending WordCampus, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;fill out the survey &lt;/a&gt;and help spread the word. The more interest Carden generates, the more likely it is that the WordPress Foundation will back the event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47850</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/what-do-you-want-to-see-in-wordpress-4-4</link>

The post has generated a number of comments from the community. Some of the most popular suggestions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REST API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fields API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Term Meta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcake UI&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;RICG Responsive Images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posts 2 Posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the items suggested are at various stages of development and there&amp;#8217;s no guarantee any of them will make it into WordPress 4.4. However, the comments provide insight into what a lot of developers want in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress Foundation Begins Accepting Applications for the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47835</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-begins-accepting-applications-for-the-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KimParsell.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-36619&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KimParsell.png?resize=655%2C418&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp San Francisco 2014 By Sheri Bigelow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordCamp San Francisco 2014 By Sheri Bigelow
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the WordPress Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/&quot;&gt;created a scholarship&lt;/a&gt; in memory of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away&quot;&gt;Kim Parsell&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate her life and contributions to WordPress. With the date and location secured for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/philadelphia-pa-to-host-wordcamp-us-december-4th-6th&quot;&gt;WordCamp US&lt;/a&gt;, applications for the scholarship are now &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/kim-parsell-scholarship-application&quot;&gt;being accepted&lt;/a&gt; by the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the scholarship are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a scholarship for a woman contributor with financial need who has never attended WordCamp San Francisco before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will cover the ticket cost, flight, and lodging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will not cover things like taxis, meals outside the official event, or airport transportation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One scholarship is awarded per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is funded by the WordPress Foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application deadline is September 2, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decision will be made by September 16, 2015, and applicants contacted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the nature of this scholarship &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/&quot;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt;, applicants must fulfill four requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A woman (this includes trans women)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An active contributor to the WordPress open source project (through one of the contributor teams or as a local meetup/WordCamp organizer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone with financial need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone who has never attended WordCamp San Francisco (the precursor to WCUS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim was an older woman who encouraged others, especially women around the same age group to get involved with WordPress. In light of this, older women are highly encouraged to apply for the scholarship if you meet the other requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim once told me that attending WordCamp San Francisco 2014 was one of the best experiences of her life. It was her first WordCamp San Francisco and although she was unemployed at the time, she was able to attend thanks to financial assistance received from the &lt;a title=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to Jen Mylo, the WordPress Foundation, and Matt Mullenweg for not only creating the scholarship, but for providing the opportunity for others to potentially have the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Hybrid Core 3.0 Experiments With Community-driven Documentation</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47825</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/hybrid-core-3-0-experiments-with-community-driven-documentation</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Core 3.0, developed by Justin Tadlock, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://themehybrid.com/weblog/hybrid-core-version-3-0-mr-reynolds&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;. More than a year in the making, 3.0 has over 269 commits and a slew of new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the release of Hybrid Core 2.0 last year, Tadlock assumed it would be at least two years before he tackled another major release, &amp;#8220;I’d planned on doing minor and patch releases for a while, all along building themes,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;However, a lot has changed in the theming world in just the past year. WordPress has added a lot of cool features for theme authors that were previously handled by Hybrid Core,&amp;#8221; Tadlock said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadlock wants the project to feel fresh and one way to do that is to remove features that are handled natively by WordPress. Features removed from Hybrid Core include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atomic hooks functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random Custom Background extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Featured Header extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaner Caption extension (handled in WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop title/description (replaced by WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pagination (replaced by WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s clear that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/&quot;&gt;customizer in WordPress is here to stay&lt;/a&gt; and will be an important part of the project&amp;#8217;s future. Hybrid Core 3.0 adds a variety of enhancements that make the customizer more flexible, these include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color Palette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Checkbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropdown Terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio Image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Select.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a few customizer setting classes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array Map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image Data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tadlock Experiments with Community-driven Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the largest changes to the Hybrid project is opening up documentation to be community-driven. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/wiki&quot;&gt;Hybrid Core wiki&lt;/a&gt; hosted on Github is now open to contributions from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadlock believes that this will drive adoption of the framework by more theme authors, &amp;#8220;The more developers we have using and contributing to the project, the better,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the community responds well to the experiment, it will allow Tadlock to focus on longer-form tutorials for club members, something he feels he&amp;#8217;s better at doing than reference style documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Core 3.0 includes a number of features, bug fixes, and improvements. If you want to see all of the changes in 3.0, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/blob/master/changelog.md&quot;&gt;lengthy changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress 4.3 “Billie” Named After Jazz Singer Billie Holiday Is Available for Download</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47803</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-billie-named-after-jazz-singer-billie-holiday-is-available-for-download</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After four months of development led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://konstantin.obenland.it/&quot;&gt;Konstantin Obenland&lt;/a&gt;, WordPress 4.3 &amp;#8220;Billie&amp;#8221; named after jazz singer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billieholiday.com/&quot;&gt;Billie Holiday&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/billie/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;. This release features menus in the customizer, strong passwords by default, site icons, and variety of other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Menus in the Customizer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now create, add, and edit menus in the customizer while previewing changes to your site in real-time. Unlike other parts of the customizer, previewing menus should be fast as it uses a new hybrid transport layer. Weston Ruter, who contributed to fast previews in the customizer &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/fast-previewing-changes-to-menus-in-the-customizer/&quot;&gt;explains the approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to enable fast previewing of menu changes by default. So we implemented a &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;refresh&lt;/code&gt; hybrid approach which uses &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt; to sync the menus settings to the preview, and then the preview does an Ajax request to render just the contents of the menu container, and this Ajax response is then inserted into the DOM to replace the previous menu container. The technical name for this approach we have been calling &amp;#8216;partial refresh&amp;#8217;, but you can call it fast preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, previewing menus in most themes should be a fast experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/menu-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47806&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/menu-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Menu Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Menu Customizer
&lt;h2&gt;Strong Passwords by Default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Jaquith &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/&quot;&gt;led the effort&lt;/a&gt; to improve the way passwords are chosen and changed in WordPress. On the account management page, clicking the Generate Password button generates a strong password by default. The password strength meter is better integrated into the password field which lets users know immediately when their password is weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/better-passwords.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47807&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/better-passwords.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Better Passwords in WordPress&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Better Passwords in WordPress
&lt;p&gt;The same interface is on the add new user screen, the password reset screen, and the WordPress install screen. While WordPress doesn&amp;#8217;t require users to have a strong password, it does everything it can to encourage users to choose one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, WordPress no longer emails passwords and password reset links expire after 24 hours. When your password or e-mail changes, WordPress sends you an email so if someone hijacks your browser session and changes these items, you’ll be notified that it happened, and you can take action. You can disable these e-mails via the &lt;code&gt;send_pass_change_email&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;send_email_change_email&lt;/code&gt; filters by setting them to false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Icons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icons&lt;/a&gt; are images that represent a website across multiple platforms. You can configure your Site Icon in the Site Identity panel within the customizer where you can upload a 512X512 sized image. This image will be used for browsers, iOS, Android, and Microsoft devices when a visitor bookmarks your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;h2&gt;Text Patterns, Quick Link Toolbar, and Word Count Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editor in WordPress 4.3 has &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/text-patterns-and-the-quick-link-toolbar-in-wordpress-4-3&quot;&gt;undergone more improvements&lt;/a&gt; with text shortcuts, a quick link toolbar, and word count changes. Text patterns or text shortcuts allow you to quickly add unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, and blockquotes without having to use a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When starting a new paragraph with one of these formatting shortcuts followed by a space, the formatting will be applied automatically. Press Backspace or Escape to undo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the visual editor in WordPress 4.3, typing &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and hitting the space bar will generate a bulleted list. Typing &lt;code&gt;1. &lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;1)&lt;/code&gt; and hitting space will generate a numbered list. If you don’t want to create these lists or do so in error, clicking the undo button or hitting &lt;code&gt;ctrl/cmd+z&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt; will undo the text pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a paragraph with two to six number signs &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a heading. Similarly, the greater-than symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;## = H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### = H3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### = H4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;##### = H5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;###### = H6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick Link Preview Toolbar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click a link in the WordPress 4.3 visual editor, a small inline link toolbar displays the full URL with buttons to edit or remove it. This avoids having to use the Insert/edit link modal window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47792&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png?resize=571%2C102&quot; alt=&quot;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3
&lt;p&gt;Word and character counts have also changed in WordPress 4.3. Instead of updating counts when pressing enter or return, it will refresh when you stop typing. A lot more characters that shouldn’t be counted as words are excluded. Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe, WordPress core contributor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/wordcharacter-count-updates-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;lists other notable changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to the Admin Bar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 moves the Customize link to the top-level menu of the admin bar. This link opens the customizer, allowing you to manage menus, appearance, and widgets through the customizer interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46995 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png?resize=429%2C232&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46996 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png?resize=428%2C202&quot; alt=&quot;WP43AdminBar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Admin Bar
&lt;p&gt;The Dashboard, Themes, Widgets, and Menus links take users to their corresponding admin pages in the backend of WordPress. This makes it clear which interface users are about to enter. The enhancement is a result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32678&quot;&gt;ticket #32678&lt;/a&gt; where Helen Hou-Sandí and other WordPress core contributors discussed ways to improve the context of each link over the course of five weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Noteworthy Changes&lt;/h2&gt;

Also, check the rest of your heading structure to ensure it’s semantic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/24/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;Multisite focused changes in 4.3&lt;/a&gt; specifically, the introduction of get_main_network_id()&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The code that powered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/30/legacy-theme-preview-removed-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;old theme preview has been removed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/08/list-table-changes-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;List tables have undergone API and UI changes&lt;/a&gt;, with the introduction of a primary column concept and easier subclassing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 is the result of hundreds of paid and non-paid volunteers working tirelessly to improve the software used on more than 24% of the web. If you experience any issues with WordPress 4.3, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;report them on the support forums&lt;/a&gt;. Volunteers are watching support threads closely and if warranted, will create a thread listing known issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enjoy the full upgrade experience, I encourage you to listen to Lady sings The Blues by Billie Holiday as you upgrade your WordPress sites.&lt;/p&gt;

Or maybe that person is you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://automattic.com/work-with-us/&quot;&gt;Automattic is hiring for a variety of positions&lt;/a&gt;, and for all except two you can live and work wherever you like in the entire planet. There are also a number of other benefits; the main downside it&amp;#8217;s a high performance culture and expectations are extremely high. Automattic hires the best folks regardless of geography, and we are &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; looking for people right now outside of US timezones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Text Patterns and the Quick Link Toolbar in WordPress 4.3</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47790</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/text-patterns-and-the-quick-link-toolbar-in-wordpress-4-3</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/QuickLinkToolbarFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47794&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/QuickLinkToolbarFeaturedImage.png?resize=675%2C209&quot; alt=&quot;Quick Link Toolbar Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/34547181@N00/4309431757&quot;&gt;metal chain&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 is on schedule to be released &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-3-project-schedule/&quot;&gt;August 18th&lt;/a&gt; and contains a number of improvements. Among the enhancements to the visual editor are text patterns. Text patterns or text shortcuts allow you to quickly add unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, and blockquotes without having to use a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the visual editor in WordPress 4.3, typing &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and hitting the space bar will generate a bulleted list. Typing &lt;code&gt;1. &lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;1)&lt;/code&gt; and hitting space will generate a numbered list. If you don&amp;#8217;t want to create these lists or do so in error, clicking the undo button or hitting &lt;code&gt;ctrl/cmd+z&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt; will undo the text pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a paragraph with two to six number signs &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a heading. Similarly, the greater-than symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;## = H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### = H3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### = H4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;##### = H5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;###### = H6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a few tries to figure out but once I got the hang of it, I discovered that I prefer using text patterns versus clicking the appropriate button in the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the blockquote text pattern places text into a blockquote and automatically closes it while also starting a new paragraph. Traditionally, I highlight text and click on the blockquote button in the editor. Often times, I have to visit the text editor and close the blockquote to start a new paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Boren, WordPress core lead developer, created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/01/editor-enhancements-in-4-3-%E2%9C%A8/&quot;&gt;following video&lt;/a&gt; which shows the text patterns in action on a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Previews of Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.2 included a subtle but convenient feature for adding links to text. Pasting the URL to highlighted text automatically turns it into a link. The problem is that there isn&amp;#8217;t an easy way to preview the URL without opening it in a new browser tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click a link in the WordPress 4.3 visual editor, a small inline link toolbar displays the full URL with buttons to edit or remove it. This avoids having to use the Insert/edit link modal window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47792&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png?resize=571%2C102&quot; alt=&quot;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preview Links in The WordPress 4.3 Visual Editor
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to Word and Character Counts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word and character counts have also changed in WordPress 4.3. Instead of updating counts when pressing enter or return, it will refresh when you stop typing. A lot more characters that shouldn&amp;#8217;t be counted as words are excluded. Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe, WordPress core contributor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/wordcharacter-count-updates-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;lists other notable changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;character&lt;/strong&gt; count, we no longer exclude any of these characters. This means that numbers and common western punctuation are no longer excluded compared to 4.2. Emoji and other astral characters are now counted as one character instead of two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a new type &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt;, in addition to words and characters, that will count characters including spaces. This seemed necessary for Japanese and maybe other languages. This is now &lt;code&gt;character_including_spaces&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;character_excluding_spaces&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcodes and HTML comments are now excluded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view details and a summary of all the work that went into improving word counts, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30966&quot;&gt;ticket #30966&lt;/a&gt; on trac. As someone who uses the WordPress content editor for a living, I&amp;#8217;m anxiously looking forward to utilizing these enhancements on an everyday basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: A WordPress conference for higher education: coming to a campus near you?</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14001</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-ed-conference-wordcampus/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Thus far, there have been numerous niche WordPress conferences aiming toward for-profit initiatives and geared toward businesses, marketers, or eCommerce site owners. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://bamadesigner.com/&quot;&gt;Rachel Carden&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s concept for a niche, education focused, non-profit event is unique and I&amp;#8217;d love to see it happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As she notes, universities have unique challenges for managing websites and are also great candidates for utilizing WordPress to its full potential. What follows is her pitch and public brainstorming session on what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org/&quot;&gt;higher education focused WordPress conference&lt;/a&gt; might look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started with a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ooh. Dream with me: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampus?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;: A WordCamp for folks using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordPress&lt;/a&gt; in Higher Education.&quot; I like it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/heweb?src=hash&quot;&gt;#heweb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&quot;&gt;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rachel Carden (@bamadesigner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/628324358126235648&quot;&gt;August 3, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCamp U.S. made a big announcement that was all over Twitter, Chris Lema tweeted what we were all thinking, and I couldn’t help but start daydreaming about the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I’m a web designer and developer with a passion for all things WordPress, especially using WordPress to build the world of higher ed web. Having spent the last 8 years working in higher education, I’m always looking for ways to utilize the power of WordPress to fulfill my campus’s needs and to help its communication grow, whether it’s using the powerful CMS to stretch limited resources or using its new API capabilities to share information, and break down silos, across campus departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love attending WordCamps and other WordPress-related events, but the issues we generally encounter in higher ed are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like online businesses or blogging, higher ed is a world of its own with unique challenges, content, stakeholders, and target audiences. In our world, we don’t worry so much about which eCommerce plugin is best. Instead, we’re more concerned with things like how to manage a large-scale network of faculty blogs, making sure we’re abiding with FERPA regulations, or wondering how to best implement single sign-on that integrates with Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m proposing a new event in the WordPress community: a conference focused on using WordPress in the world of higher education. I call the idea “WordCampus”. (Kind of a perfect name, right? How did nobody think of this before?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name “WordCampus” came to me from a tweet and does not, at this point, imply it would be an official WordCamp event. If needed, I’m open to organizing an event that is not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation. This is a detail that remains to be seen, but honestly, at this point, all details remain to be seen. A WordCamp representative has confirmed that a user group specific WordCamp is possible, but I would need to prove that it could draw a crowd. That’s why I need your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a WordPress conference for higher ed is something you would be interested in (whether it’s as an attendee, speaker, planner, sponsor, or all of the above), I invite you to read a few of my thoughts, share yours in the comments, and visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org/&quot;&gt;wordcampus.org&lt;/a&gt; to show your support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cost and fee consideration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like your usual WordCamp, the goal for this event is to keep the costs and ticket price as low as possible. The point of this event is professional development and community, not profit. The phrases “big budget” and “higher ed” don’t generally appear in the same sentence anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of higher ed-oriented web conferences can run upwards of $500 so an inexpensive, but valuable, event would be attractive for most higher education web professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unique sponsorship opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having sponsors to help with costs would be crucial and I am open to all kinds of support, whether it’s monetary or in-kind. Sponsoring an event like WordCampus would be a unique way to get an organization’s name in front of one of the best communities &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of WordPress that &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; WordPress all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of higher education, you often have limited resources, so there are plenty of opportunities for third party products or services like hosting, themes, plugins, custom design, accessibility consulting, and custom development, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Location is a factor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location could be a sticking point, as high travel costs might be a deal breaker for many WordCampus attendees. The beauty of local WordCamps is that they are tied to a geographical region and therefore, for most attendees, have limited travel requirements. This could be a problem for an event that is not tied to a specific region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue wise, universities have beautiful facilities, so I’d love to host the event on an actual college campus and, if the hosting university could donate the space in kind, this would be a huge cost saver. The most preferable universities would also be located near a major airport to help reduce travel time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m really dreaming big, it would be great to find numerous universities that would be willing to host and, therefore, we could have regional WordCampus events spread across the country. I don’t think this is outside the realm of possibility, but would depend on interest and attendance. I&amp;#8217;m certainly interested in hearing from anyone that may be interested in hosting WordCampus at their university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A big target audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a wide variety of WordPress users in higher ed, from the university-level WordPress developers and administrators, to the users who run WordPress for a college, to the faculty members using WordPress as a learning tool, and any students who’d love to learn a thing or two (they are our future, you know). That’s not even including content strategists, designers, social media managers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCampus has the potential to attract a variety of users who could inspire a multitude of topics and professional development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A broad variety of topics, even within the education umbrella&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of topics, these could also run the gamut from higher ed marketing and content strategy to infrastructure, managing multi-author blogs, and streamlining application processes. Accessibility should also be a featured topic as federally funded institutions are required by law to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I see the structure of higher ed as tailor-made for the open source mindset and would love to hear someone encourage collaboration and openness by comparing the ideologies of open source with the inner workings of higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Event timing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As organizing something of this magnitude takes time, I’m looking at a 2016 booking. What time of the year in 2016, however, remains to be seen. There are obviously a lot of variables at play, from venue availability to which time of the year is best for our target attendees. In higher ed, you need time to clear your schedule and request funding, so I’d want to allow for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the middle of the semester is best for most higher ed professionals, but this can vary depending on their field. And if we’re being honest, the majority of fall might be out of the question because of football season. We’ve included a straw poll &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org&quot;&gt;on the event landing page&lt;/a&gt; to help us gauge which time of year might be best for those interested in attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read through my proposal and hopefully interested parties will have a few additional thoughts for the comments. If you would like be notified of any future developments, or show your support for the project, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org&quot;&gt;wordcampus.org&lt;/a&gt; to share a little bit of information. And don’t forget to tell your friends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, or would like to chat, you can also find me on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner&quot;&gt;@bamadesigner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I had great BBQ in San Francisco last week at a new place called Smokestack. The brisket was on-point, and competitive with anything I&amp;#8217;ve had in Texas. &lt;a href=&quot;http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2014/05/08/magnolia-opens-dogpatch-brewery-and-its-restaurant-smokestack/#photo-451076&quot;&gt;This review in the SF Chronicle covers things pretty well&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;#8217;re hankering for some great Southern food in SF this is the place to check out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47770</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-1-2-3-patches-xss-vulnerability</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WP REST API version 1.2.3 and 2.0 Beta 4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/14/rest-api-v1-2-3-and-v2-0-b4/&quot;&gt;address a security issue&lt;/a&gt; that affects sites running 1.2 or 2.0 beta. This release fixes a potential XSS vulnerability related to JSONP support in 1.2 and 2.0 of the API. Automatic updates are in progress for 1.2.3 but if your site hasn&amp;#8217;t automatically updated, the team suggests updating manually as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the security release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/&quot;&gt;2.0 Beta 4&lt;/a&gt; includes a number of enhancements, some of which break backwards compatibility. Developers and beta testers should read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/releases/tag/2.0-beta4&quot;&gt;detailed changelog&lt;/a&gt; and release notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Nick Haskins Rebrands Lasso to Editus</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47763</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/nick-haskins-rebrands-lasso-to-editus</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In mid July, Nick Haskins, founder and lead developer of Lasso, was served a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/nick-haskins-receives-cease-and-desist-letter-for-violating-lassosoft-trademarks&quot;&gt;cease and desist letter&lt;/a&gt; from LassoSoft. LassoSoft argued that Lasso violates its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=861046116&quot;&gt;registered trademarks&lt;/a&gt; and causes confusion to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EdiusFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-47764&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EdiusFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C182&quot; alt=&quot;Edit us Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Instead of fighting litigation, Haskins decided to rebrand the product from Lasso to&lt;a href=&quot;https://edituswp.com/lasso-is-now-editus/&quot;&gt; Editus.&lt;/a&gt; The name was suggested by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iklektive.com/&quot;&gt;Gavin Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;. According to Haskins, the only references to the name is a band in Costa Rica and a directory in Luxemburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a new domain and cloned website, Lasso 0.9.8 is available for download which includes the renaming of various admin menu items that used the term Lasso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lasso 0.9.8 Requires a Manual Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haskins says users will need to update to 0.9.8 manually because of the switch in domain names but automatic updates will return after 0.9.8,  &amp;#8220;Updates after 0.9.8, will continue to be automatic, just as the way they were before,&amp;#8221; Haskins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesopinteractive LLC is &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickhaskins.com/2015/07/on-life-and-family/&quot;&gt;looking for a buyer&lt;/a&gt; but after receiving low offers, Haskins has decided to use a broker to facilitate the sale. The broker requested that the rebrand of Lasso be completed before proceeding with the sale process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Editus has a nice ring to it, what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Death of Mobile Web</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45292</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/08/death-of-mobile-web/</link>
	<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile web and mobile in-app behaviour are not binary. When users are in the facebook app, they spend a tremendous amount of time accessing the mobile web through facebook’s own in-app browser. The same for twitter and others. We enter social apps for discovery and then access the mobile web while still in-app. It is a mistake to conflate time spent on the mobile web with time spent in a traditional browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen. Tony Haile of Chartbeat: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonyhaile.com/2015/08/11/a-correction-around-the-death-of-the-mobile-web/&quot;&gt;A correction around the death of the mobile web.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 Adds Statistical Insights</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47740</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-version-5-4-adds-statistical-insights</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=&amp;ct=&quot;&gt;available on the app store&lt;/a&gt; and includes a couple of new features. To compliment the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-5-3-released-with-refreshed-stats-and-a-new-layout-for-posts-and-pages&quot;&gt;improvements to stats in 5.3&lt;/a&gt;, 5.4 adds a new stats screen called insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insights is similar to the Right Now widget in the WordPress dashboard in that it displays a summary of key statistics for a site including, total number of published posts, views, visitors, and the best traffic day. There&amp;#8217;s also a section that displays the current day&amp;#8217;s stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_7433.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47744&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_7433.png?resize=282%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Stat Insights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stat Insights
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 5.4, you could only add images to posts that were stored on the device. WordPress for iOS 5.4 adds the ability to insert images from the WordPress media library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add an image from the WordPress media library, select media library from the menu at the top of the screen. If you have a lot of items in the media library, it may take a few minutes to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WPiPhoneMediaLibrary.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-47746&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WPiPhoneMediaLibrary.png?resize=500%2C399&quot; alt=&quot;WP For iOS 5.4 Media Library Selection&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other improvements include the ability to search the My Sites list and viewing embedded images in comments. This makes it easier to see the full context of a comment without having to view it in a different part of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the team fixed a bug that caused the app to not restore its state properly. WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=&amp;ct=&quot;&gt;free and available&lt;/a&gt; on the app store. If you encounter any issues, you&amp;#8217;re encouraged to report them on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ios.forums.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress for iOS support forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Short Interview With Nikolay Bachiyski WordPress’ Security Czar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47728</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/short-interview-with-nikolay-bachiyski-wordpress-security-czar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While on stage at &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Europe&lt;/a&gt; answering a question related to WordPress’ security track record, Matt Mullenweg named &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/nbachiyski&quot;&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski&lt;/a&gt; as the first Security Czar for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Bachiyski to learn why the role was created and what its purpose is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the responsibilities of your new role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responsibilities are to coordinate the security efforts of&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;mostly with incident response and to make sure we respond quickly, have solid fixes, and make sure everyone involved is informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What circumstances led to this role&amp;#8217;s creation?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing too spicy around the creation of the role. As the volume of requests increased, we realized a bit more structure would be helpful so that we are more focused and use our resources wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you only handle security issues for the open source project or will you also help with Automattic’s bounty program as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other colleagues at Automattic who are responsible for the bounty program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are the connections and trust you’ve established over the last 11 years to your role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offline relationships are very important in an online community and I am lucky to know many of the members of the security team in person. This definitely makes working with them easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn More About the WordPress Security Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;d like to learn more about who&amp;#8217;s on the WordPress security team, what they do, and how they handle security releases, listen to my interview with Gary Pendergast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pendergast who works for Automattic, is a WordPress core contributor, and a member of the WordPress core security team. In the interview, we discuss what happened behind the scenes before &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/plugin-developers-demand-a-better-security-release-process-after-wordpress-4-2-3-breaks-thousands-of-websites&quot;&gt;4.2.3 was released&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Avis GPS</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45255</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/08/avis-gps/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After an amazing WordCamp Scranton on Saturday I was heading to a friend&amp;#8217;s birthday on Long Island on Sunday, a few people were surprised I had flown from New York and said driving took about the same amount of time when you factor in all the airport hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Google Mapped it and it did look like it was only 5-6 hours from Scranton to where I was going. Being a born and raised Texan, I love a good drive, and I probably haven&amp;#8217;t had a proper road trip since my sister&amp;#8217;s birthday a few years ago when we went up Highway 1. I&amp;#8217;ve also never driven on the East Coast, and it seemed like there were some really pretty parks and lakes in between Scranton and Long Island so I ended up going to the airport anyway because that&amp;#8217;s where the rental cars were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avis.com/&quot;&gt;Avis&lt;/a&gt;. They try harder. &lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/s.ma.tt/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=604&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt; One thing they do that&amp;#8217;s pretty cool is sell  decent cables, USB wall chargers, and car chargers for a cheap price right at the check-in desk. (I always carry my own car charger, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Incase-Speed-Charger-Lightning-Cable/dp/B00P7Y6M2Y/&quot;&gt;this is my current pick&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s super-handy in Ubers as well.) Amazingly though they still try to give you one of those Garmin GPS units that&amp;#8217;s worse than your smartphone in every possible way. I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s a money maker, otherwise the only reasonable thing to do would be provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O5JARCI&quot;&gt;a smartphone mount&lt;/a&gt; (or have one already set up in the car) rather than saddling people with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/559938/ref=zg_b_bs_559938_1&quot;&gt;archaic, non-networked navigation device&lt;/a&gt; that has no idea about construction or traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up going to a Walmart that was nearby to pick up a car mount (price, $12) that ended up being a life-saver for the trip. &lt;strong&gt;I also believe that every person in tech should visit Walmart at least once a year, and spend time in their technology section.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s good to understand and see how people who don&amp;#8217;t live for technology every day interact with it. It&amp;#8217;s eye-opening, and it&amp;#8217;s handy to know what&amp;#8217;s in stock in case you need 50 feet of ethernet at 4 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping the car off in Manhattan, it looks like they charged me $20 for a GPS which I don&amp;#8217;t even have, so now going to need to sort out both the fee and the &amp;#8220;missing&amp;#8221; GPS system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl; dr: Smart car rental companies should ditch the GPS, provide smartphone mounts instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Organizing Team Explains Why Philadelphia Should Host WordCamp US</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47699</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/organizing-team-explains-why-philadelphia-should-host-wordcamp-us</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When organizing teams in different &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2015-now-accepting-applications-for-host-city&quot;&gt;cities applied to host&lt;/a&gt; WordCamp US earlier this year, they provided a substantial amount of information through the application process. While &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/philadelphia-pa-to-host-wordcamp-us-december-4th-6th&quot;&gt;Philadelphia will host&lt;/a&gt; the event in 2015 and 2016, their application is not public information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juliana Reyes, who writes for &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly&quot;&gt;Technical.ly Philly&lt;/a&gt;, acquired and &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly/2015/08/11/wordcamp-us-philadelphia-wordpress-devs/&quot;&gt;published a few&lt;/a&gt; of the responses from the organizing team&amp;#8217;s application, specifically questions four, nine, ten, and eleven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question nine on the application asks, why do you think your city should host WordCamp US 2015? The organizing team responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Philadelphia is the birthplace of our nation. The United States started here, and so should WordCamp US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’re ideally situated on the East Coast between New York and Washington DC, and the halfway point between the West Coast and parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With a population of 1.5 million, it is the 5th largest city in North America, and is a cultural hub for all things food, music, art, and technology. It is well-known for its many excellent medical and educational facilities, including the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Drexel University, and the University of the Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With over 1,200 daily inbound and outbound flights, Philadelphia is easy to reach from anywhere in the world. The average hotel room and cost of living, is far below any other major East Coast city, and nowhere else has cheesesteaks like we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve yet to visit Philadelphia but one thing I&amp;#8217;ve learned is that residents take their reputation for cheesesteaks seriously. Be sure to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly/2015/08/11/wordcamp-us-philadelphia-wordpress-devs/&quot;&gt;the post&lt;/a&gt; to see the team&amp;#8217;s responses to the other three questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: ThemeConf a Conference for Front-End Developers and Designers September 2nd-4th, 2015</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47686</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/themeconf-a-conference-for-front-end-developers-and-designers-september-2nd-4th-2015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ThemeConfLogo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-47688&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ThemeConfLogo.png?resize=215%2C181&quot; alt=&quot;ThemeConf Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://themeconf.com/&quot;&gt;ThemeConf&lt;/a&gt; is a new conference set to take place September 2nd-4th, 2015, in Keswick, England aimed at front-end developers and designers. Confirmed speakers include a handful of Automattic theme wranglers, Noel Tock of Human Made, freelancer Adam Onishi, and Chris Hutchinson of The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session schedule is expected to be released later this week however, here are some of the topics that will be covered at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Craft, workflow and best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser performance and developer tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and photography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript and REST APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Lenox and Tammie Lister, who are the primary organizers of the event, originally came up with the idea for ThemeConf at the Automattic UK Christmas dinner, &amp;#8220;Lenox wanted to bring a conference to where he lives in the Lake district and I wanted to do one focusing on themes,&amp;#8221; Lister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two have been planning the event since January of this year. Although most of the confirmed speakers work with WordPress, ThemeConf is not dedicated to it, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s geared to those making themes in general and working on the front end. We have tried hard not to focus on WordPress,&amp;#8221; Lister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.to/themeconf/2015&quot;&gt;Tickets for ThemeConf&lt;/a&gt; are £49 and £99 respectively. The £49 tickets are for speaker sessions only while the £99 tickets include access to a workshop on using the REST API and lunch. Accommodations in the Lake District two hours from Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Liverpool and Leeds are available through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keswick.org/&quot;&gt;Keswick.org.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/08/46m-scam/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;An incredible story: &lt;a href=&quot;http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/tech-firm-ubiquiti-suffers-46m-cyberheist/&quot;&gt;Tech Firm Ubiquiti Suffers $46M Cyberheist&lt;/a&gt;. Notable for two reasons: I love Ubiquiti&amp;#8217;s products, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubnt.com/products/#enterprise&quot;&gt;especially their Unifi line&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;#8217;ve never heard of phishing getting so much from a single victim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Surpasses One Billion Total Downloads</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47673</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-surpasses-one-billion-total-downloads</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The WordPress project achieved a milestone earlier today as the official WordPress plugin directory &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/&quot;&gt;surpassed one billion&lt;/a&gt; total downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1billiondownloads.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47674&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1billiondownloads.png?resize=944%2C312&quot; alt=&quot;One billion total plugin downloads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;More than one billion total downloads
&lt;p&gt;According to Scott Reilly who helps maintain WordPress.org, we&amp;#8217;ll never know which plugin generated the one billionth download. That&amp;#8217;s because WordPress.org doesn&amp;#8217;t log information that matches downloads to plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A download counter exists for each plugin for each day and the total amount is the summation of all those daily download counts,&amp;#8221; Reilly said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As WordPress&amp;#8217; &lt;a href=&quot;http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all&quot;&gt;market share&lt;/a&gt; continues to grow, so does the amount of downloads from the plugin directory. The following numbers are the total amount of downloads from March 2006 to August 2015. This year, the directory is on pace to serve more than 300 million downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 2006  191,567&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2007  2,845,802&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2008  15,130,856&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2009  49,822,116&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2010  72,342,598&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2011  108,501,907&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2012  141,609,682&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2013  182,236,517&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014  241,142,505&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 2015 to August 2015  186,243,700&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took nine years for the plugin directory to reach one billion downloads, when do you think it will reach two billion?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: SkiPress a Week Long Excursion in the French Alps</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47654</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/skipress-a-week-long-excursion-in-the-french-alps</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SkiPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-47658&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SkiPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=852%2C269&quot; alt=&quot;SkiPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you enjoy skiing and WordPress, mark your calendars for &lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;SkiPress&lt;/a&gt;, November 21-28, 2015. SkiPress is a week long excursion to Serre Chevalier, a ski resort in the French Alps. The cottage can hold up to 15 people where attendees can ski, discuss WordPress, develop code, or disconnect from technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;Bernard-Jacquet&lt;/a&gt; who writes for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-spread.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WP-spread&lt;/a&gt;, and helps organize the local WordPress meetup in Grenoble, France, is organizing the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooms at the cottage cost 350 euros. This amount covers the room for a week plus dinner at two restaurants. Prepare to bring some extra cash as the bus, skipass, and ski rental are additional costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s not an official deadline to book a room but the sooner you book the better. If you&amp;#8217;re interested in booking a room, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;contact Berard-Jacquet&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible so he can make arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Richard Best Publishes Human Readable Version of the GPLv2 License</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47645</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/richard-best-publishes-human-readable-version-of-the-gplv2-license</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is licensed under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/&quot;&gt;GPLv2&lt;/a&gt; and the four freedoms it allows is considered to be its &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/&quot;&gt;Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt;. The four freedoms are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to benefit from your changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more to the GPL than the four freedoms listed above however, the license details can be difficult to read and decipher. Richard Best, a qualified lawyer in New Zealand, England, and Wales, has published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpandlegalstuff.com/a-human-readable-summary-of-the-gpl/&quot;&gt;human readable summary&lt;/a&gt; of the GPL license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by how Creative Commons offers a &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot;&gt;human readable version&lt;/a&gt; of its licenses, the summary explains the core concepts of the GPL and outlines the position in relation to copying, distribution, fees, modifications/derivative works, distributing non-source forms, termination, and downstream licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to note that the document is not endorsed by the Free Software Foundation nor a substitute for the full license text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GPLSummarySample2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47647&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GPLSummarySample2.png?resize=705%2C554&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of the human readable summary of the GPL&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sample of the human readable summary of the GPL
&lt;p&gt;I encourage everyone participating in the WordPress ecosystem to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/&quot;&gt;full license&lt;/a&gt; text at least once. However, the summary does a good job explaining the core components of the GPL without having to dig into the license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions concerning the GPL, I suggest seeking legal council with a lawyer familiar with software licensing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress Core Team Receives Praise for Their Efforts to Maintain Security</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47619</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-core-team-receives-praise-for-their-efforts-to-maintain-security</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Netanel Rubin, a vulnerability researcher for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.checkpoint.com/&quot;&gt;Check Point Software&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/&quot;&gt;credited&lt;/a&gt; for properly disclosing a security vulnerability to WordPress, published the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/08/04/wordpress-vulnerabilities-1/&quot;&gt;first in a trilogy of posts&lt;/a&gt; that explains how he discovered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability was discovered during a full audit of WordPress&amp;#8217; code base in which Rubin praised the efforts of the WordPress development team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to these frequent findings in 3rd party plug-ins’ code, barebones WordPress issues are rare, as WordPress core developers are well-trained to hold high security awareness for all released code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can confirm that during our audit of the source code, we witnessed the developers ‘leaving nothing to chance’, and implementing multiple layers of security protecting most attack vectors we could think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress developers deserve praise for their efforts to maintain such complex software in this level of security, specifically considering the presence of the notoriously trigger-happy foot-gun called PHP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/08/04/wordpress-vulnerabilities-1/&quot;&gt;reading the post&lt;/a&gt; as it&amp;#8217;s a brief look into the mind of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat&quot;&gt;white hat&lt;/a&gt; security researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although WordPress has &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-4-patches-six-security-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;seen its fair share&lt;/a&gt; of security related releases this year, it&amp;#8217;s reassuring to hear a third-party whose job it is to penetrate software security praise WordPress&amp;#8217; codebase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The Mantra of Family Comes First</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47609</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-mantra-of-family-comes-first</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FamilyFirstFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47611&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FamilyFirstFeaturedImage.png?resize=669%2C247&quot; alt=&quot;Family First Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/63122283@N06/11867028263&quot;&gt;Mama&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/recap-of-prestige-a-conference-geared-towards-growing-businesses&quot;&gt;Prestige over the weekend&lt;/a&gt;, I heard a presenter say that family comes first. This isn&amp;#8217;t the first time I&amp;#8217;ve heard this advice but it&amp;#8217;s becoming more prevalent. I generally hear this advice from those who are living comfortably, have two kids or more, and/or have gone through the startup process more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a distributed worker who receives a check every two weeks. I&amp;#8217;m married, have no kids, and write about WordPress for a living. Putting family first should be easy but it&amp;#8217;s not. The last two years as a distributed worker, I&amp;#8217;ve put work before family unless it&amp;#8217;s an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, my wife and I had a serious conversation about the way I work and how it has negatively impacted our marriage. I&amp;#8217;m a late owl and on most nights, my wife sleeps alone. As a distributed worker, I get to make the rules and put myself in the best environment to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation with my wife involved words not fit for reproduction but everything she said was right. I&amp;#8217;m spending too much time on digital devices and not enough with her. Our conversation was the wake up call I didn&amp;#8217;t know I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not easy putting family first all the time. Some argue that you need to put yourself before family so that you can provide for them. Others find a critical balance between spending time with family and getting the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you put family first when there are bills that need to be paid, sites to be built, and a constant deluge of work to be done? Please share your thoughts, experiences, and advice in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<ul>
<li>Add option to center form on page</li>
<li>Improve styling classes for more consistency across different field classes, and make all classes responsive</li>
<li>Added a few more styling classes: frm_three_fourths, frm_two_fifths, frm_three_fifths</li>
<li>Remove in-place-editing from the field keys on the form builder page</li>
<li>Add 'frm_after_update_field_name' hook for changing a field name during editing</li>
<li>Update Bootstrap multiselect to v0.9.13</li>
<li>Add license page to prepare for add-ons. Big things are coming.</li>
<li>Fix: Prevent loading icon from being huge in some themes</li>
<li>Fix: When the jQuery UI css is loaded by another plugin on the form builder page, the required icon looked the same whether required or not. This styling conflict is resolved.</li>
<li>Fix: Make sure the form description size can be changed in the styling settings.</li>
<li><strong>Pro Features:</strong></li>
<li>Views can now be filtered by fields in the repeating sections.</li>
<li>Added [parent_id] shortcode for use in views. This shortcode will only have a value when the displaying entries in repeating sections.</li>
<li>Allow views to be created using the repeated entries. Since each repeating row is an entry in a hidden form, we can allow views to be created using those repeating rows for more flexability.</li>
<li>Added order parameter to frm-entry-links</li>
<li>Allow options in a post status field to come from the form builder. The options should have separate values and the saved values can include 'publish', 'draft', 'private', 'scheduled'.</li>
<li>Remove the option to lock field and form keys. This is more of a hassle than a feature.</li>
<li>Allow the entry key to be used with the frm-field-value shortcode instead of forcing the entry</li>
<li>Replaced inline 50px height for image fields with .frm_image_from_url class for easier control</li>
<li>Improve file upload field in Chrome to prevent extra space from showing.</li>
<li>Added 'frm_save_post_name' filter. This can be used for custom form actions that create posts.</li>
<li>Added 'frm_display_data_opts' filter.</li>
<li>Prevent frm_display_id custom field from saving when a field is selected in the create post settings instead of customized content</li>
<li>Fix: When forms were submitted without ajax, the redirect wasn't working consistently.</li>
<li>Fix: The shortcodes weren't processing in the message shown after an entry is updated. </li>
<li>Fix: When we prevented the PayPal action from triggering on import, we stopped all actions. This is now fixed so an action can be set (in the code) to be triggered on import. Posts will now be created on import again.</li>
<li>Fix: The dynamic list field was showing the entry ID in the entries tab instead of the value.</li>
<li>Fix: The Add row button wasn't showing in a repeating section when returning to edit an entry if there were more than two rows in the section.</li>
<li>Fix: Improve dropping a field between two sections.</li>
<li>Fix: Remove nonce check for frm-entry-update-field shortode. Page caching gives front-end nonce checks issues.</li>
<li>Fix: We changed the parameters sent to the frm_after_update_field hook without realizing it. The 'field_id' attribute was sometimes an object, but was previously always an integer. This has been updated for reverse compatibility, and 'field' has been added with the full field object.</li>
<li>Fix: If you put -100 for the start date in a date field, -100 would show in the date field instead of 1915. This is now working correctly for dynamic values like this with three digits.</li>
<li>Fix: When filtering a view with a Dynamic field, NOT EQUAL TO will work correctly.</li>
<li>Fix: Double quotes were causing trouble when included inside an error message returned by the frm_validate_field_entry hook</li>
<li>Fix: Graphs using x_axis and start_date were having trouble</li>
<li>Fix: The js error after selecting an option in autocomplete field is fixed when there are calculations in the form.</li>

<p>A. Try the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Double check to make sure your email address is present and correct in the "Emails" tab on the form "Settings" page</li>
<li>Make sure you are receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password...)</li>
<li>Check your SPAM box</li>
<li>Try a different email address.</li>
<li>Install WP Mail SMPT or another similar plugin and configure the SMTP settings</li>
<li>If none of these steps fix the problem, let us know and we'll try to help you find the bottleneck.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Q. How do I edit the field name?</h4>

<p>A. The field and form names and descriptions are all changed with in-place edit. Just click on the text you would like to change, and it will turn into a text field.</p>

<h4>Q. Why isn't the form builder page working after I updated?</h4>

<p>A. Try clearing your browser cache. As plugin modifications are made, frequent javascript and stylesheet changes are also made. However, the previous versions may be cached so you aren't using the modified files. After clearing your cache and you're still having issues, please let us know.</p>

</ul>

<h4>6.3.3</h4>

<h4>6.1.1</h4>

<ul>
<li>Due to many questions about tracking code placement, <a href="http://forums.ronaldheft.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&#38;t=967">an FAQ article</a> has been written to address these placement questions. If you have any questions, this is a recommended read.</li>
<li>Corrects issues related to selecting user roles to exclude from tracking / seeing the dashboard widget.</li>
<li>Cleans up the display of user role names for WordPress versions below WordPress 3.0.</li>
<li>Updates the included jQuary Sparkline library to 1.5.1, thus adding support for viewing the dashboard graph in all versions of Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>Adds two hooks, google_analyticator_extra_js_before and google_analyticator_extra_js_after, enabling other WordPress plugins to insert additional tracking code.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6.1</h4>

<ul>
<li>Prepares Google Analyticator for WordPress 3.0 compatibility.</li>
<li>Updates the async tracking snippet to the latest version provided by Google. This new update solves issues with IE7 and IE6, and fixes all problems related to the snippet being placed in the  section of a page. You can rest easy knowing that async tracking in the  is completely compatible with IE now.</li>
<li>Adds an html comment to the page header when tracking code is hidden due to the user admin level. This should make is less confusing for new Google Analyticator users, wondering if their tracking code is visible to the world.</li>
<li>Adds a setting to specify a specific profile ID. This will help users with multiple Analytics profiles, by allowing them to specify which profile to use with the dashboard widget.</li>

<h4>6.0</h4>

<ul>
<li>Switches current tracking script (ga.js) to the new awesome async tracking script.

<li>Removes settings made obsolete due to the new async tracking (footer tracking and http/https).</li>
<li>Fixes the (not set) pages in the Top Pages section of the dashboard widget. Pages containing the title (not set) will be combined with the correct page and corresponding title. Note that I am still trying to get this bug fixed in the Google Analytics API; this is just a hold over until the bug is fixed.</li>
<li>Adds a link to Google Analytics on the dashboard widget for quick access to view full stat reports.</li>
<li>Fixes a Javascript error that prevented the dashboard widget from collapsing.</li>

<li>Updates the included jQuery sparklines plugin to the latest version, 1.4.3.</li>
<li>Adds an experimental function to retrieve page visitors stats for theme developers. This function is not final and only provided for advanced users who know what they're doing. Future versions will improve on the code already in place. Find the get_analytics_visits_by_page in google-analyticator.php to learn how to use. Use at your own risk.</li>
<li>Fixes several security flaws identified during a recent security audit of Google Analyticator.</li>
<li>Removes references to Spiral Web Consulting. Google Analyticator is now being developed exclusively by Ronald Heft.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WordPress v4.3 Compat./Bug Fix</strong> This release of s2Member alters the way New User Notification Emails are sent, and in how they should be formatted in WordPress v4.3+.</p>

<p>The New User Notification Email is now sent (to a user) only if they did <em>not</em> set a Custom Password during their registration; i.e., only if they need this email to set their password for the first time. In short, s2Member now follows the same approach used by WordPress v4.3+.</p>

<p>See:  <strong>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member  &#8594; General Options &#8594; Email Configuration &#8594; New User Notification</strong></p>

<p>So the purpose of this particular email has changed just a bit; i.e., the New User Notification Email. Instead of it being sent to every new user, it is only sent to users who need it for the purpose of obtaining a password which grants them access to their account for the first time.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrading to WordPress v4.3 and the latest release of s2Member?</strong></p>

<p>Please review this section of your Dashboard carefully:
<strong>s2Member  &#8594; General Options &#8594; Email Configuration &#8594; New User Notification</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using s2Member to customize the New User Notification email, you should try to update this message so that it includes the new <code>%%wp_set_pass_url%%</code> Replacement Code.</li>
</ul>

<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode that was causing <code>levels="0"</code> not to work, and in fact any use of a <code>0</code> in the <code>levels=""</code> attribute was broken. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/663">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond for reproducing, reporting and testing this issue.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Emoji Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in s2Member's SSL filters that can be applied with the Post/Page Custom Field <code>s2member_force_ssl</code> being set to <code>yes</code>. A symptom of this bug was to see an SSL warning in the latest release of WordPress related to the new Emoji library. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/674">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>v150722</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>New Shortcode:</strong> This release introduces a powerful new shortcode which allows you to display a user's EOT (End of Term) or NPT (next payment time) in a WordPress Post or Page. For further details and some minor limitations, please see <a href="http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2eot-shortcode-documentation/"><code>[s2Eot /]</code> Shortcode Documentation</a>. Props to @raamdev and @patdumond for their strategic assistance, feedback, and ideas for this shortcode.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Strong Password Enforcement:</strong> This release of s2Member makes it possible for a site owner to enforce strong passwords; i.e., to require a minimum number of characters and a specific strength (i.e., mix of required characters). The default minimum length in s2Member changed from <code>6</code> to <code>8</code> characters minimum. The default password strength minimum is <code>good</code>. To customize, please see: <strong>s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; Registration/Profile Fields &#38; Options</strong>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/573">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond and @KTS915 for ideas and feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>reCAPTCHA v2 Upgrade:</strong> This release of s2Member comes with an updated reCAPTCHA&#8482; integration in order to take advantage of No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA and other enhancements provided by the v2 update on Google's end.</p>

<p><em>Existing s2Member installations that already have an old set of reCAPTCHA v1 Public/Private keys will continue to function as before. However, it is suggested that you configure reCATPCHA v2 keys in order to put s2Member Pro-Forms into the v2 mode moving forward. Please see: <strong>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; CAPTCHA Anti-Spam Security</strong> where you will find instructions.</em></p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>PayPal IPN Compat.</strong> This release addresses a problem with IPN connection failures that result in a 500 Internal Server Error on the PayPal side; occurring whenever s2Member attempts to verify IPN data. Please see: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/610">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in Stripe Pro-Form Checkout Options, where a Free Registration option could cause other paid Checkout Options to result in a checkout error under the right conditions. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/569">this GitHub issue</a> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>Google Analytics Compat.</strong> This release automatically preserves <code>utc_</code> variables that are used by Google Analytics whenever a Membership Options Page redirection occurs. i.e., if a visitor comes to the site with <code>utc_</code> variables and is redirected to the Membership Options Page, because the content they were trying to access is protected; the <code>utc_</code> variables are preserved during this redirection, and delivered as part of the Membership Options Page redirect.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net Endpoint Filters:</strong> This release adds two new WordPress Filters (i.e., Hooks) that can be used by developers in certain rare cases. Hook names are <code>ws_plugin__s2member_pro_authnet_aim_endpoint_url</code> and <code>ws_plugin__s2member_pro_authnet_arb_endpoint_url</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/575#issuecomment-104077606">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details and a quick example of use.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net AIM Compat.:</strong> This release addresses a compatibility issue that came to light recently, which was actually attributed to a bug in s2Member Pro that has been sliding through unnoticed until now. The format for an expiration date sent to the Authorize.Net AIM API should be <code>MM-YYYY</code>. The format for ARB API calls is <code>YYYY-MM</code>. s2Member Pro was sending <code>YYYY-MM</code> to both APIs. Fixed in this release. Props to @raamdev for investigating this. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/576">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug:</strong> This release corrects an issue in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode that was preventing the <code>display_name</code> DB column from being searchable. This release also adds the <code>display_name</code> to the list of default <code>search_columns=""</code> that are considered by the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode. Props to @patdumond for researching this. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/578">this GitHub issue</a> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects an issue where s2Member would fail to subscribe customers to configured mailing list IDs whenever an existing customer is upgrading and you have the Double Opt-In Checkbox turned off entirely. Fixed. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/581">this GitHub issue</a> if you would like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in s2Member's Stripe Pro-Forms, related to having multiple Checkout Options. The bug resulted in a missing error message whenever one of the Checkout Options was submitted incorrectly, and also resulted in the default Checkout Option being magically selected instead of the one that a customer was working with. Props to @patdumond and @bryanthankins. See: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/586">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release fixes an issue where the s2Drip shortcode was requiring PHP 5.3+; this fix allows the shortcode to work properly with PHP 5.2+.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Compat.</strong> A call to <code>WP_Widget</code> was updated to support WordPress v4.3+. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/607">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in the s2Member IPN handler that processes full refunds. In your s2Member EOT Behavior options, if you choose the  <code>refunds,partial_refunds,reversals</code> option it results in a full refund not being processed; i.e., an EOT does not occur as expected. s2Member was incorrectly recording that your configured preference was not to process refunds whenever a full refund occurs. Fixed in this release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/614">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Wikpedia Links:</strong> Updated throughout to use an <code>https://</code> protocol. Now the Wikipedia default. This impacts mostly the back-end of s2Member which references a few articles at the Wikipedia. However, it also impacts Pro-Forms where a link is provided to users with more information about Security Codes that appear on the back of credit cards. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/617">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>qTranslate X Compat.</strong> This release includes a minor update that improves compatibility with qTranslate X. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/618">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>AWeber Compat.</strong> This release resolves an issue with AWeber rejecting subscribers that have IPv6 addresses. Until such time as AWeber adds support for IPv6 addresses, s2Member will simply send an empty IP address whenever it encounters an IPv6 address. This behavior was requested by the AWeber team. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/611">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Expiration:</strong> This release improves the way coupons that are set to expire are handled. Instead of expiring at midnight the day before the configured  expiration date, coupon codes now expire at the end of the configured day. As always, all times are calculated from GMT/UTC time, the same as WordPress itself. In short, if you set a coupon to expire Dec 5th, the coupon will now expire Dec 5th, at the end of the day (UTC time). The old behavior, was for the coupon to expire Dec 4th at midnight UTC time, which led to confusion in many cases. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/612">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>IPN Proxy Key Bug:</strong> This release corrects a minor bug in s2Member's IPN Proxy Key generation that was causing problems in just a few edge cases. This bug may have impacted your site if you had a domain name being accessed with a <code>Host:</code> header containing mixed caSe. Not normal behavior, but there are a few edge cases where it's important for s2Member to get this right in order to avoid an "Unable to verify $_POST vars." error. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/590">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Password Reset Layout:</strong> This release improves the layout/CSS applied to the WordPress password reset form in order to better separate the password strength indicator from the instructions provided by WordPress. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/585">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond, @BugRat, and @raamdev for discovering this.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member) <strong>Back-end UI Quick Links:</strong> This release resolves an overlap in the display of the quick links atop each menu page in the Dashboard. This bug impacted the lite version only. If you'd like additional details, please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/589">this GitHub issue</a>. Props to @raamdev for discovering this.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Username Compat.:</strong> This release updates s2Member's own validation against usernames in order to bring it inline with the most recent versions of WordPress core; i.e., we now allow whitespace in usernames. This release was updated so that usernames are validated only by the WordPress core function: <code>sanitize_user()</code>, which does allow single whitespace characters in usernames. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/566">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Message After Modification:</strong> This release improves the default response that a customer who is upgrading/downgrading receives after having completed checkout using a Pro-Form. Instead of asking the customer to "log back in", s2Member simply says, "Thank you. Your account has been updated.". There is no reason for a customer to log back in; i.e., this is not necessary, and that message was leading to some confusion. Note also that with Pro-Forms you can provide a Custom Return URL on Success using the <code>success=""</code> shortcode attribute. Thus, this message is simply a default. We suggest that you customize in all cases. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/580">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond for reporting this important issue.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Documentation Update:</strong> This releases improves the documentation for the <code>rrt=""</code> shortcode attribute in all Pro-Form implementations; e.g., PayPal Pro-Forms, Authorize.Net Pro-Forms, and Stripe Pro-Forms. The <code>rrt=""</code> attribute can be somewhat misleading, so we added the following: <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> If you don't offer a trial period; i.e., the first charge occurs when a customer completes checkout, you should set this to the number of additional payments, and NOT to the total number. For instance, if I want to charge the customer a total of 3 times, and one of those charges occurs when they complete checkout, I set should this to <code>rrt="2"</code> for a grand total of three all together.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects an issue with EOT calculations under a specific circumstance. If a customer registered on the site for free, and later made a purchase that included a free trial period, and they canceled within the trial period, the EOT was being incorrectly calculated based on the user's WordPress registration time instead of being based on the time that their trial began. This resulted in an immediate EOT (due to it being a date in the past), instead of being set to the end of the trial. Fixed in this release.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Documentation Update:</strong> This release replaces a specific symbol that has been used throughout the Dashboard with s2Member. Instead of the <code>⥱</code> symbol we are now using the more compatible <code>&#8594;</code> symbol instead. This is used to indicate a Dashboard path.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>E_NOTICE:</strong> Several <code>E_NOTICE</code>-level warnings were resolved in this release. Note that <code>E_NOTICE</code>-level warnings only show up in <code>WP_DEBUG</code> mode for developers, but they are frustrating nonetheless. Props to @raamdev for reporting some of these.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal Pro-Forms selling to customers who choose a Maestro/Solo card may experience problems in some circumstances. GBP currency conversion was partially failing due to a change in the underlying API that s2Member calls upon. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/605">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Opt-In Bug Fix:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects a bug that was causing members to be automatically unsubscribed from your mailing list whenever you choose to hide the Double Opt-In Box. A customer updating their profile later without this box, was being unsubscribed inadvertently. Fixed in this release. Props to @raamdev for his work in reproducing and reporting this bug. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/633">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Workaround:</strong> It came to our attention that some Stripe API calls that simply update the <code>name</code>, <code>address_state</code>, <code>address_zip</code>, and <code>address_country</code> for tax reporting purposes were resulting in a card decline even after Stripe approved the transaction. We suspect this is a bug in the Stripe API. It has been reported to Stripe. For now though, we are working around this issue by failing gracefully in such a scenario. This simple update is there only for tax reporting purposes, so if it fails it does not warrant a refusal to complete the transaction.m It is simply logged by s2Member for analysis. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/535">this GitHub issue</a> where a deeper investigation is underway for our next maintenance release.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe API Update:</strong> This release of s2Member takes advantage of the latest Stripe API version. Moving from <code>v2015-02-18</code> to <code>v2015-07-13</code>. See <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#api-changelog">this article at Stripe</a> if you'd like additional details. <em>Remember that s2Member's API calls to Stripe will always use this specific version of their API (<code>v2015-07-13</code>), even if your Stripe account is configured with an older default version. This is to ensure that s2Member works as intended for all site owners.</em></p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Prepaid Cards:</strong> This release makes it possible for site owners to reject prepaid cards if they choose to do so. Stripe has the ability to determine if a credit/debit card is backed by a prepaid funding source. If it is, you can choose to reject or allow this type of card. The default behavior is to accept it. See: <strong>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Stripe Options &#8594; Account Details &#8594; Reject or Allow Prepaid Cards</strong> for further details. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/505">this GiHub issue</a> if you'd like more information. Props to @raamdev for determining the feasibility of this feature.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> <code>Notice: Undefined index: password1</code> in <code>paypal-registration-in.inc.php</code>. This was another <code>E_NOTICE</code>-level warning that was cleaned up in this release. Props to @raamdev See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/634">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> This release fixes a bug in Stripe Pro-Forms where upon a customer applying a 100%-off coupon code, the customer is met with an erroneous error regarding a missing state/zipcode--and only when a site owner has defined a tax configuration file also. Fixed in this release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/548">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Automatic Update Compat.:</strong> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Configuring_Automatic_Background_Updates">Automatic Background Updates</a> were introduced in WordPress v3.7 and while by default only WordPress core updates are updated automatically in this special way, it's still possible to enable automatic background updates for everything; including themes and plugins. For instance, some web hosting companies enable automatic/background plugin updates in an attempt to improve overall security.</p>

<p>That's fine. However, when s2Member Pro is installed, it works as an add-on for the s2Member Framework plugin, and any update of the Framework plugin requires a manual or interactive update of the Pro add-on. Otherwise your site is left with only a portion of its original functionality until you complete the update. For that reason, starting with this release of s2Member, automatic background updates of the s2Member Framework are disabled automatically when you are also running s2Member Pro.</p>

<p>Props to @raamdev for addressing this issue and providing the source code which made this enhancement possible. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/523">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p>

<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WordPress v4.3-beta Compat.:</strong> This release was tested against WordPress v4.2+, including WordPress v4.3-beta. A few minor adjustments were made to improve support in the upcoming release of WordPress v4.3 based on beta releases made available to us.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>goo.gl URL Shortener:</strong> This release addresses a problem with the Google URL Shortening API. Google now requires that you configure an API key. Otherwise, API calls will fail often and s2Member reverts back to tinyURL instead. Starting with this release, if you enable the Google URL Shortener, you will need to supply an API key for it to work as expected. See: <strong>s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; URL Shortening Service Preference</strong> for further details. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/587">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @bridgeport for reproducing and reporting this bug.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bitly URL Shortener:</strong> This release adds support for Bitly to be used as your preferred URL Shortening service. Bitly has become very popular for many reasons. One reason to choose Bitly over others is that you can configure your Bitly account to use a custom domain of your choosing; i.e., shortened URLs may contain <a href="https://bitly.com/a/settings/advanced">a domain that you configure</a>. See: <strong>s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; URL Shortening Service Preference</strong> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Other Gateways:</strong> Starting with this release, when you install the s2Member Pro add-on for the first time, there are two Pro gateways enabled by default. When you first install s2Member Pro (first-time users only), both the Stripe and PayPal Pro payment gateways will already be enabled for you. This is to help site owners avoid confusion. In addition, first-time users will be greeted by s2Member Pro with a reminder to configure your "Other Gateways". See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/528">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @raamdev for identifying this usability issue and providing feedback/suggestions.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stats Collection:</strong> Starting w/ this release of s2Member Pro, we are now collecting important/anonymous server details that will help us better understand which versions of PHP/MySQL are most widely used by site owners running the pro version of our software. For further details, please see: <a href="http://s2member.com/kb-article/what-information-does-s2member-pro-report-to-websharks/">What anonymous information does s2Member Pro report to WebSharks, and why?</a></p></li>

<h4>v150311</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> The list of users in the WordPress Dashboard was going blank in a particular scenario where a search was attempted in concert with a sortable s2Member column. Fixed in this release. Props to @bridgeport for finding this. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/496#issuecomment-76821470">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug Fix:</strong> This release resolves an issue with pagination in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode after recent changes in the <code>WP_User_Query</code> class. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/493">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Remote Operations API (Bug Fix):</strong> If a remote API call was made to find a user by <code>user_login</code>, and that username was all numeric, the <code>WP_User</code> class treated it like a user ID instead of as an actual username. Resolved in this release by calling <code>new WP_User(0, [user login])</code> as the second argument to the constructor. Thereby forcing <code>WP_User</code> to consider it a username. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/498">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> Stripe Pro-Forms for Specific Post/Page Access should not disable the email address field for logged-in users. Resolved in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/500">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Pro-Forms:</strong> This release corrects a bug first introduced in the last release that prevented custom templates for Stripe Pro-Forms from working as intended. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/510">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix for Gift/Redemption Codes:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects a bug that impacted the generation of Gift/Redemption Codes whenever they were sold with Specific Post/Page Access.

<h4>v150225</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Accept Bitcoin via Stripe!</strong> This release of s2Member Pro comes integrated with the latest version of the Stripe API, where it is now possible to accept Bitcoin right along with most major credit cards&#8212;made possible by <a href="https://stripe.com/bitcoin">Stripe's latest update to support Bitcoin</a>. It's as easy as flipping a switch :-) Please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member Pro &#8594; Stripe Options &#8594; Account Details &#8594; Accept Bitcoin</code>. Referencing <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/482">this GitHub issue</a>; i.e., the original feature request.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe API Upgrade:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro updates the Stripe SDK and Stripe API to the latest version (Stripe API version: <code>2015-02-18</code>). In addition, this release forces a specific version of the Stripe API in all communication between Stripe and s2Member; thereby avoiding a scenario where the Stripe API could be updated again in the future, in ways that might prevent s2Member Pro from operating as intended. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/484">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details. Props to @pauloz1890 for reporting this.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Security Badge Sizes:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects an issue with the <code>[s2Member-Security-Badge v="1" /]</code> shortcode. If you set <code>v="2"</code> or <code>v="3"</code>, the dimensions were miscalculated. Props to @Mizagorn See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/pull/466">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Opt-in checkbox state (and some custom fields) were losing state when switching from one type of Pro Form to another&#8212;whenever Pro Form Checkout Options were in use. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/468">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @zenzoidman for finding this!</li>
<li>(s2Member) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Alt. View Restrictions stopped working on navigation menu items in the previous release of s2Member v150203 due to a default argument value being misinterpreted by a sub-routine. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/475">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Some site owners reported "paying" customers being left with a Membership Level of <code>0</code> at seemingly random times that may have occurred only once in every 300+ transactions. The issue was related to a regular expression being performed against encrypted binary data with an ungreedy <code>?</code> in the regex pattern. Certain characters in the binary output would be lost when specific character sequences were encountered; resulting in a random failure to decrypt cookies set by s2Member. In short, the underlying cause was identified and corrected in this release. Thanks to all who reported this. Our appreciation goes out to everyone who helped to test for this elusive bug. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/397">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>UI Enhancements:</strong> This release includes an enhanced UI, along with many subtle improvements to the inline documentation/instructions provided within the WordPress Dashboard.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Retiring Google Wallet:</strong> Google <a href="https://support.google.com/wallet/business/answer/6107573">announced that they are retiring Google Wallet for Digital Goods</a>. s2Member Pro continues to support Google Wallet, but this release updates the "Other Gateways" section in the Dashboard to make it clear that Google Wallet will not be supported in future versions of s2Member Pro. In fact, Google Wallet for Digital Goods will <a href="https://support.google.com/wallet/business/answer/6107573">close March 2nd, 2015</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>bbPress Bug Fix:</strong> This release resolves a security issue when running a Multisite Network with bbPress + s2Member. Level 0 access was being granted by the bbPress plugin across all sites in a network. That behavior is fine for bbPress, but is unexpected when s2Member is running in a Network environment. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/465">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. <strong>IMPORTANT TIP:</strong> If you experienced this issue, please read through <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/465#issuecomment-76039842">these important comments</a> about bbPress Participants needing to be removed from child blogs in order to fully rid yourself of this problem; i.e., once you complete the update of s2Member, you should <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/465#issuecomment-76039842">also read this please</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>404 / Alt. Views Bug Fix:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects a rare issue where the Membership Options Page (or other pages) can produce random 404 errors whenever s2Member's Alt. View Restrictions are enabled, and there is another plugin installed which runs a DB query using the <code>WP_Query</code> class <em>before</em> the Main WP Query has been run. Resolved through the use of <code>-&#62;is_main_query()</code> instead of tracking it statically via <code>$initial_query</code>.

</ul>

<h4>v150203</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Gift/Redemption Codes:</strong> This release adds a powerful new shortcode: <code>[s2Member-Gift-Codes /]</code>. This makes it easy to generate and sell access to gift codes (i.e., gift certificates) and/or to a list of redemption codes. For instance,  where a single team leader might like to purchase multiple accounts they can distribute to others on a team, or in a group. Video demo here: <a href="http://s2member.com/r/giftredemption-codes-video/" rel="nofollow">http://s2member.com/r/giftredemption-codes-video/</a> ~ See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/386">this GitHub issue</a> for additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>User-Specific Coupon Codes:</strong> This release of s2Member makes it possible to configure Pro-Form Coupon Codes that are connected (i.e., only valid) when entered by specific Users/Members who are logged into the site. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/403">this GitHub issue</a> for additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Max Uses:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro adds the ability to set a maximum number of times that a Coupon Code can be used. This makes it easy to create Coupon Codes that are designed to be used only one time, for instance; or for X number of times. After a Coupon Code is used X number of times, it will expire automatically. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Usage Tracking:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro adds the ability to track the number of times that each of your Coupon Codes have been used. It is also possible to alter the number of uses, and/or set a maximum number of uses. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Active/Expires Dates:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro makes it possible to establish both a start and end time for each of your Pro Coupon Codes. In previous versions of s2Member, it was only possible to set an expiration date. You can now create Coupon Codes that will become active at some point in the future automatically. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code UI Enhancements:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro comes with an updated UI that makes it easier to manage your Pro Coupon Codes. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Store Coupon Codes for Each User:</strong> s2Member Pro now stores a list of all coupon codes that a customer has used on your site. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; Users &#8594; Choose User [Edit]</code>. Scrolling down to the set of s2-related fields will reveal a new list of coupon codes. This list will be filled for new customers only; i.e., s2Member does not have this data for past purchases; only for new customers that you acquire after updating to the latest release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/462">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>EOT Custom Value:</strong> In this release of s2Member, the <code>get_user_option('s2member_custom')</code> value is preserved after an EOT has taken place, making it possible for site owners to continue to read this value (along with any custom pipe-delimited values they have injected there), even after an EOT has taken place. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/449">this GitHub issue</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>JW Player Broken Links:</strong> This release corrects some broken links referenced by the inline documentation for s2Member in the WordPress Dashboard. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/448">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Security:</strong> This release of s2Member checks for the existence of the WordPress PHP Constant: <code>WPINC</code> instead of looking for the less reliable <code>$_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']</code>. Some site owners reported this was causing trouble in a localhost environment during testing, or when running s2Member on some hosts that are missing the <code>SCRIPT_FILENAME</code> environment variable; e.g., some Windows servers. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/454">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Advanced Import/Export Compat:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro includes compatibility and a bug fix when running on WordPress v4.1+. Three PHP notices during importation, along with some quirky behavior associated with the <code>role</code> CSV column have been corrected. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/455">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug Fix:</strong> This release resolves an issue with pagination in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode after recent improvements to the search functionality. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/155#issuecomment-69403120">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Enhancement:</strong> This release improves search functionality in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode, making it so that all searches default to <code>*[query]*</code>; i.e., are automatically wrapped by wildcards. If a user enters a wildcard explicitly (or a double quote), this default behavior is overridden and the search query is taken as given in such a scenario. This makes the search functionality easier for end-users to work with, since it no longer requires an exact match. Default behavior is now a fuzzy match. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/394">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>AWS v4 Authentication:</strong> This release of s2Member adds AWS v4 Authentication support for Amazon Web Service Regions that only accept the AWS v4 authentication scheme. If you had trouble in the recent past when attempting to integrate s2Member with S3 Buckets (or with CloudFront) in regions outside the USA, this release should resolve those issues for you. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/440">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Pro-Form Checkout Options not working in all cases whenever they are used together with Free Registration Forms. Resolved in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h4>v150102</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Custom Field Mapping:</strong> This release of s2Member adds an internal mapping from s2Member's Custom Field values for each user, to the <code>get_user_option()</code> function in the WordPress core. This makes it possible to retrieve user custom field values like always via <code>get_user_field()</code> or now through the native <code>get_user_option()</code> function also. The benefit of this is that s2Member's custom fields are now more compatible with other themes/plugins for WordPress.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>[s2Member-List /] Shortcode:</strong> It is now possible to search through custom fields created with s2Member using the <code>search_columns=""</code> attribute; e.g., <code>search_columns="user_login,user_email,s2member_custom_field_MYFIELDID"</code>; where <code>MYFIELDID</code> can be replaced with a field ID that you generate with s2Member via <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; Registration/Profile Fields</code>. See also: <a href="http://www.s2member.com/kb/s2member-list-shortcode/">this KB article</a> for further details. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/155">this GitHub issue</a> for details regarding this improvement.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>MailChimp Bug Fix</strong> This release fixes a bug first introduced in the previous release, which was causing Interest Groups configured w/ s2Member to not be added properly. Resolved in this release. Props to @ethanpil Thanks!</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>ccBill Buttons</strong> This release updates all ccBill button graphics. The MasterCard logo has been removed, and a new set of buttons was created to improve upon the set provided in previous versions of s2Member Pro. See: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/392">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net</strong> The <code>AUD</code> currency code is now supported by Authorize.Net, and thus, s2Member Pro has been updated to support the <code>AUD</code> currency code for Pro-Forms integrated with Authorize.Net. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/383">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Subscr. CID for Stripe</strong> This release corrects a bug which made it impossible to update the Subscr. CID value (for Stripe) using the user edit form in the Dashboard. For further details, please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/380">this GitHub issue</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug fix</strong> s2Member's membership access times log was failing to collect all required access times under certain scenarios where multiple CCAPS were being added or removed in succession within the same process, but across multiple function calls. This resulted in unexpected behaviors (in rare cases) when attempting to use the <code>[s2Drip /]</code> shortcode. Fixed in this release. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/406">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Compatibility</strong> This release includes a fix for s2Member's Multisite Network patches applied to the <code>wp-admin/user-new.php</code> file whenever you configure s2Member on a Multisite Network. This change makes s2Member compatible with the coming release of WordPress v4.1 and v4.2-beta as it exists now. See: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/410">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> A feature that was previously introduced in v140816, which made it possible for site owners to set a failed payment threshold (in s2Member's Authorize.Net integration), was suffering from an off-by-one issue during total failed payment calculations. Fixed in this release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/416">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Feature Enhancement:</strong> Whenever a failed payment threshold is reached (in s2Member's Authorize.Net integration), not only will s2Member terminate on-site access, but now the underlying ARB (Automated Recurring Profile) is cancelled at the same exact time. This way future billing attempts on the Authorize.Net side will not be possible; i.e., it ensures that a failed payment threshold will always terminate both on-site access and the ARB itself together at the same time, as opposed to allowing the ARB termination to occur automatically via Authorize.Net, <em>whenever</em>. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/416">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>ClickBank Disclaimer:</strong> This release of s2Member adds a default Auto-Return Header Template (customizable from <code>s2Member &#8594; ClickBank Options</code> in the Dashboard) which includes a disclaimer that ClickBank requires of most merchants before final approval.</p>

<p><em>This default template should help to reduce the time it takes new merchants to receive final approval from ClickBank when first starting out in the ClickBank network. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/412">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</em></p></li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal Pro-Forms for Specific Post/Page Access, and configured with <code>accept="paypal"</code> (i.e., to accept PayPal only) were not hiding the entire Billing Method section as intended. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/399">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal Pro-Forms using Express Checkout for Billing Agreements under a non-native currency (i.e., under a different currency than their own PayPal account) were failing under some scenarios (notably with the <code>BRL</code> currency code). Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/414">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe API:</strong> s2Member's Stripe integration has been updated to use the new <code>statement_descriptor</code> field in favor of the now deprecated <code>statement_description</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/422">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> In the case of a global tax rate having been applied to the total cost, there were certain scenarios where s2Member Pro would kick back an error message, "Invalid Parameters to Stripe". Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/425">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WP Core Compat.:</strong> This version of s2Member forces the <code>wptexturize</code> filter off in WordPress, due to a bug that was introduced in recent versions of the WordPress core; which results in broken shortcodes in some scenarios. Until the underlying bug is fixed in the WP core, the <code>wptexturize</code> filter must be disabled to prevent corruption of any WordPress shortcode that may contain <code>&#60;</code> or <code>&#62;</code> symbols.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/349">this GitHub issue</a> for further technical details. Also referencing: <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29608">this WordPress core bug report</a>.</p></li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Alt. Views:</strong> This release fixes a bug that caused <code>wp_list_pages()</code> not to be filtered properly under certain scenarios. A symptom of this bug was to apply s2Member's Alt. View protection for "Pages", but for this not work properly in all cases. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/372">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Currency Code/Symbol:</strong> All email templates, API Notifications (except cancellation/EOT notifications), and all Custom Return URLs on Success; across all payment gateways; now support two additional Replacement Codes: <code>%%currency%%</code> and <code>%%currency_symbol%%</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/314">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Codes:</strong> All transaction-related email templates now support three additional Replacement Codes: <code>%%full_coupon_code%%</code>, <code>%%coupon_code%%</code>, and <code>%%coupon_affiliate_id%%</code>. These have been documented in your Dashboard in places where transaction-related email templates are configured. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/384">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Tax Info:</strong> s2Member now attaches metadata to Stripe Charges and to Stripe Subscriptions which includes a JSON-encoded object containing two or more properties when tax applies.</p>

<p>These metadata properties can be found in your Stripe Dashboard with the metadata key: <code>tax_info</code>; which contains the following JSON-encoded properties: <code>tax</code> (total tax that was or will be charged on the regular amount), <code>tax_per</code> (tax percentage rate that was applied based on your configuration of s2Member Pro); along with <code>trial_tax</code> and <code>trial_tax_per</code> in the case of a Stripe Subscription that includes an initial/trial period that requires payment; i.e., the tax applied (if any) to an initial/trial payment on a Subscription.</p>

<p>We hope this additional information being recorded by s2Member and stored securely within your Stripe account will make it easier for you to maintain accurate bookkeeping records moving forward. This additional metadata is generated for new customers only. It will not be backfilled for any past transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Tax Info:</strong> s2Member now passes the tax location; i.e., <code>address_state</code>, <code>address_zip</code>, and <code>address_country</code> to each Stripe Card object associated with a Stripe Customer.</p>

<p>We hope this additional information being recorded by s2Member and stored securely within your Stripe account will make it easier for you to maintain accurate bookkeeping records moving forward. This additional cardholder data is collected and stored for new customers only; it will not be backfilled for any past transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe IP Address:</strong> s2Member now attaches the customer's IP address (as detected via <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> on your server) into each Stripe Customer object, along with the customer's full name. These metadata properties can be found in your Stripe Dashboard with the metadata keys: <code>name</code> and <code>ip</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Coupon Code:</strong> s2Member now attaches metadata w/ a coupon code used by your customer (if applicable) to each Stripe Charge and/or Stripe Subscription object.</p>

<p>This metadata property can be found in your Stripe Dashboard with the metadata key: <code>coupon</code>; which contains the following JSON-encoded property: <code>code</code> i.e., the full coupon code used by your customer. This additional metadata is generated for new customers only. It will not be backfilled for any past transactions. Filled only for transactions that use a coupon code.</p></li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Invoice:</strong> This release corrects a bug in s2Member's Stripe integration whereby <code>subscr-signup-as-subscr-payment</code> was not always being forced into the core gateway processor; resulting in a miscalculation of the <code>last_payment_time</code> under certain scenarios. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/396">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
</ul>

<h4>v141007</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>ClickBank IPN v6:</strong> This release enables a new integration option for site owners integrated with ClickBank. You may now choose to integrate with v6 of ClickBank's IPN service, since all previous versions are slowly being phased out by ClickBank. Please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; ClickBank Options &#8594; IPN Integration</code> for v6 config. options. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/256">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details regarding this topic. See also: <a href="https://support.clickbank.com/entries/22803622-instant-notification-service">this article @ ClickBank</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>AWeber API Integration:</strong> This release of s2Member adds a new option for site owners using AWeber. It is now possible to integrate with the new <a href="http://www.s2member.com/r/aweber-api-key">s2Member App</a> for AWeber; i.e., via the AWeber API instead of via email-based communication. For further details, please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; API / List Servers &#8594; AWeber Integration</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/303">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> The EOT Behavior option for <code>refunds,partial_refunds,reversals</code> was not being accepted by s2Member. Fixed in this release. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/345">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>MailChimp API Wrapper:</strong> This release of s2Member comes with an updated API wrapper class for MailChimp integration. No change in functionality, just a smoother, slightly faster, and more bug-free interaction with the MailChimp API. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/303">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details regarding this improvement. See also: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mailchimp/mailchimp-api-php">the official MailChimp API class</a>; i.e., what s2Member has been updated to in this release.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>URI Restrictions caSe-insensitive (Security Fix)</strong> This release of s2Member changes the way URI Restrictions work. All URI Restrictions are now caSe-insensitive (i.e., <code>/some-path/</code> is now the same as <code>/some-Path/</code>), allowing s2Member to automatically pick up different variations used in attempts to exploit the behavior of certain slugs within the WordPress core. You can also change this new default behavior, if you prefer. Please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Restriction Options &#8594; URI Restrictions</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/354">this GitHub issue</a> for the details about why this was changed in the most recent copy of s2Member.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>AWeber Role-Based Emails:</strong> In this release we're adding a note in the s2Member UI regarding role-based email addresses being rejected by AWeber. AWeber does not allow role-based emails like: <code>admin@</code> or <code>webmaster@</code> to be subscribed. It is suggested that you enable s2Member's config. option: "Force Personal Emails" if you intend to integrate with AWeber. Please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; Registration/Profile Fields</code>; where you can tell s2Member for force personal email addresses when someone registers on-site. This will prevent a potential subscriber from entering something like <code><a href="mailto:admin@example.com">admin@example.com</a></code> as their email address.</li>

<h4>Don't risk your backups on anything less</h4>

<p>Your WordPress backups are worth the same as your entire investment in your website. The day may come when you get hacked, or your hosting company does, or they go bust - without good backups, you lose everything. Do you really want to entrust all your work to a backup plugin with only a few thousand downloads, or that has no professional backup or support? Believe us - writing a reliable backup plugin that works consistently across the huge range of WordPress deployments is hard.</p>

<h4>UpdraftPlus Premium</h4>

<p>UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore is not crippled in any way - it is fully functional for backing up and restoring your site. What we do have is various extra features (including site cloning), and guaranteed support, available <a href="https://updraftplus.com/">from our website, updraftplus.com</a>. See <a href="https://updraftplus.com/comparison-updraftplus-free-updraftplus-premium/">a comparison of the free/Premium versions, here</a>.</p>

<p>If you need WordPress multisite backup compatibility (you'll know if you do), <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">then you need UpdraftPlus Premium</a>.</p>

<h4>Professional / Enterprise support agreements available</h4>

<p>UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore is written by professional WordPress developers. If your site needs guaranteed support, then we are available. Just  <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">go to our shop.</a></p>

<h4>More premium plugins</h4>

<p>If you are in the market for other WordPress premium plugins (especially WooCommerce addons), then try our shop, here: <a href="https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/" rel="nofollow">https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/</a></p>

<h4>Are you multi-lingual? Can you translate?</h4>

<p>Are you able to translate UpdraftPlus into another language? Are you ready to help speakers of your language? UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore itself is ready and waiting - the only work needed is the translating. The translation process is easy, and web-based - go here for instructions: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/translate/">https://updraftplus.com/translate/</a>. (Or if you're an expert WordPress translator already, then just pick out the .pot file from the wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/languages/ directory - if you scan for translatable strings manually, then you need to get these functions: _x(), __(), _e(), _ex(), log_e()).</p>

<p>Many thanks to the existing translators - listed at: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/translate/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/translate/</a></p>

<p>N.B. Paid versions of UpdraftPlus Backup / Restore have a version number which is 1 higher in the first digit, and has an extra component on the end, but the changelog below still applies. i.e. changes listed for 1.11.4 of the free version correspond to changes made in 2.11.4.x of the paid version.</p>

<h4>1.11.5 - 22/Aug/2015</h4>

<ul>
<li>FIX: phpseclib fix relating to generation of random numbers on some systems (affecting SFTP on some systems)</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.11.4 - 19/Aug/2015</h4>

<ul>
<li>FIX: Perform previously missing tweak on the database after restoring a multisite backup to an install with a different table prefix, which inhibited the ability to create new users on the main site in a network.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Remove an inefficiency when examining files to prune from Google Drive, reducing the amount of time needed.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Show a warning if UpdraftPlus's directory in wp-content/plugins has been manually renamed to include a space, which WordPress does not support</li>
<li>TWEAK: Skip search/replacing of the 'guid' column in the posts table when migrating (improves performance - and prevents possible re-appearances of blog articles in peoples' feed readers if double-migrating)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Upgraded the bundled phpseclib Math, Net and File libraries to current versions (1.0 branch)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Prevent PHP notice in log file when deleting FTP backup from dashboard</li>
<li>TRANSLATIONS: Updated translations, including Greek</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.11.3 - 13/Aug/2015</h4>

<ul>
<li>FIX: Fix access to S3 for PHP 5.2 users using buckets in the US-WEST-1 region</li>
<li>FIX: Fix access to UpdraftPlus Vault for some PHP 5.2 users</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.11.2 - 11/Aug/2015</h4>

<ul>
<li>TWEAK: Handle the results when someone with no UpdraftPlus Vault quota attempts to connect more gracefully</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.11.1 - 10/Aug/2015</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: UpdraftPlus Vault storage - simple to set up storage from your trusted provider: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/landing/vault" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/landing/vault</a> - with 1Gb of free storage for UpdraftPlus Premium customers ( <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftplus-premium/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftplus-premium/</a> ) - and more storage available for anyone to purchase. All other storage options (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) remain available, of course!</li>
<li>FEATURE: S3 enhanced wizard now allows the user to optionally deny the new Amazon Web Services IAM user download and/or delete permissions, for an even more secure setup (at the cost of some convenience - you will need to download/restore/delete S3 backups outside of UpdraftPlus).</li>
<li>FEATURE: Amazon S3 in UpdraftPlus Premium now supports optional server-side encryption</li>
<li>FEATURE: An "UpdraftPlus" menu now appears on the WP admin bar, allowing quick access.</li>
<li>COMPATIBILITY: Tested and compatible with WordPress 4.3</li>
<li>SPEED: For users' whose backups are created with a zip binary (the default engine, where available), CPU usage + zip creation times have been significantly reduced</li>
<li>SPEED: For users cloning a website with a large number of users and a changed table prefix, a long and slow series of SQL operations has been replaced with a single fast one</li>
<li>FIX: The chunk-uploading algorithm for Copy.Com could unnecessarily upload the same chunks multiple times. We have not had any reports, but we believe it's also theoretically possible that a Copy.Com upload could have been corrupted by the same issue, so recommend updating for all Copy.Com users.</li>
<li>FIX: Fix issue with site cloning whereby on sites with very large numbers of entries in the postmeta table that needed search/replacing, some could be omitted (in the case seen, the table had &#62;600,000 entries)</li>
<li>FIX: Saving the settings immediately after authenticating with Copy.Com resulted in being redirected to WP's page for all settings.</li>
<li>FIX: If PHP was killed by the webserver during the process of pruning old backups, then this would not be retried until the next backup, thus potentially leaving more backups than desired around in remote storage in the meanwhile.</li>
<li>FIX: Log files sometimes failed to mention the MySQL version</li>
<li>TRANSLATIONS: Various updated translations - thanks to our translators</li>
<li>TWEAK: When choosing multiple remote storage options (Premium), these are now stacked via tabs, instead of vertically as before</li>
<li>TWEAK: More help for enormous sites on badly resourced web hosting: part of the enumeration of uploads needing backing up is now cached, allowing more to be time when time limits are short</li>
<li>TWEAK: Secret credentials (e.g. S3 secret key) in the admin area are now starred (as explained in our long-standing FAQ, this does nothing to protect against malicious WordPress co-admins on your site - <a href="https://updraftplus.com/faqs/in-the-administration-section-it-shows-my-amazon-ftp-etc-passwords-without-using-stars-is-this-safe/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/faqs/in-the-administration-section-it-shows-my-amazon-ftp-etc-passwords-without-using-stars-is-this-safe/</a> - but at least we won't get asked about it so many times!).</li>
<li>TWEAK: Provide more direct help to the user if they are hosting with Strato and get the 'File Size Limit Exceeded' zip message</li>
<li>TWEAK: When migrating data directly to a remote site, if the remote site returns a 413 HTTP code ("Request Entity Too Large"), re-try using a smaller chunk size</li>
<li>TWEAK: Log when about to begin encryption of a database file (allowing the progress to be monitored more easily if there's a problem)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Detect a further case of an incompatible database (that is from a remote source and uses MySQL features not present on the destination server) and warn before attempting to import.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Make the error message shown if trying to restore an incompatible database (that is from a remote source and uses MySQL features not present on the destination server) clearer.</li>
<li>TWEAK: If the user uses "Backup Now" before saving their settings, warn them that the unsaved settings changes won't apply to this backup</li>
<li>TWEAK: Only warn about very large files found once for each file (rather than once per resumption)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add the UPDRAFTPLUS_GOOGLEDRIVE_DISABLEGZIP constant - define it as true to work-around broken HTTP setups (possibly broken outgoing proxy?) when accessing Google Drive</li>
<li>TWEAK: When claiming an add-on (paid versions), the user's updraftplus.com password will automatically be forgotten once it is no longer needed</li>
<li>TWEAK: Handle the case of the user typing in an invalid number of backups to retain more elegantly</li>
<li>TWEAK: No longer require the php-mcrypt module for Dropbox </li>
<li>TWEAK: Also retry a smaller chunk size if it looks like mod_security unhelpfully replaced a 413 HTTP code with a 200 success message despite the operation actually failing for this reason, or if it looks like sending is just timing out before the PHP timeout (so that we don't get notified).</li>
<li>TWEAK: Added new CA root certificates to store (<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem" rel="nofollow">http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem</a>)</li>
<li>TWEAK: If the Migrator's direct-send component drops its chunk size, then store this information so that it doesn't have to go through the cycle of finding the best chunk size the next time.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Added UPDRAFTPLUS_IPV4_ONLY constant to prevent use of IPv6 (currently implemented by Google Drive only)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Deal with a case where the web host appears to be losing disk I/O near kill time, despite later database writes going through (so, the order of operations was insufficient to guarantee what had been completed). This issue was only cosmetic - backup sets were intact (hence "tweak", not "fix")</li>
<li>TWEAK: Increase HTTP timeout for remote site-to-site operations</li>
<li>TWEAK: Don't cause the 'debug' tab to abort rendering if the web host has disabled the gzopen() function (which is an odd/pointless thing to do)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Resolve PHP 'strict standards' coding internal notice in Google Drive module</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.10.3 - 2015-06-09</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: Migration component can now send backup data directly from one WP site to another - <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftplus-premium/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftplus-premium/</a></li>
<li>FEATURE: Support active mode FTP servers (extremely rare)</li>
<li>FIX: The error message when choosing no components to restore was empty</li>
<li>FIX: Restore ability to run on WordPress 3.5 (actually fixed in downloads of 1.10.1 after 2015-05-13)</li>
<li>FIX: Some automatic pre-upgrade backups were not marked internally as such, leading UD to delete the oldest scheduled backup prematurely backups prematurely</li>
<li>TWEAK: Reduce HTTP round-trips when checking presence + downloading backup archives in a restore/migrate operation</li>
<li>TWEAK: Alert the user earlier if they're trying to use a database with a character set not supported by MySQL</li>
<li>TWEAK: Use separate internal jobs for separate downloads, and thus avoid race conditions when updating job data (symptom: download widgets that don't show current information)</li>

<li>TWEAK: Fix untranslated message when confirming the wiping of settings</li>
<li>TWEAK: Replace more non-SSL links to updraftplus.com with SSL links</li>
<li>TWEAK: Use a POST instead of a GET during one of the restore sub-stages (avoids a false positive on some mod_security setups)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Improve backup-file-naming routine to reduce the times when no ASCII name can be found (ASCII is preferred as not all cloud storage methods will accept arbitrary characters in filenames)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Don't keep a log file (unless debug mode is on) for scheduled tasks that result in the result that nothing needs backing up</li>
<li>TWEAK: Remove cache files from Cherry Framework child themes upon migration (framework misbehaves if cache files are present after URL change)</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.10.1 - 2015-05-12</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: Microsoft OneDrive support (Premium version) - full support (including chunked/resumable uploading and downloading)</li>
<li>FEATURE: Allow prevention of backup of unwanted tables, via a filter; see: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/faqs/how-can-i-exclude-a-specific-table-from-the-backup/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/faqs/how-can-i-exclude-a-specific-table-from-the-backup/</a></li>
<li>FIX: Restore window would not open if date contained a single quote character in it (which was possible only in some languages)</li>
<li>FIX: Restore the ability of PHP installations (&#60; 1%) without curl to use Google Drive (broke when Google introduced a new SSL certificate at their end which PHP couldn't handle properly without extra help).</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add woocommerce_order_items and relevanssi_log to the list of potentially huge tables that won't need search/replacing</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add link to admin email setting and fix broken link to reporting add-on in free version</li>
<li>TWEAK: Provide more direct help for paid users getting blocked by the security shield when connecting for updates access</li>
<li>TWEAK: Small tweak in zip-splitting algorithm if it looks likely that there are insufficient resources with no further resumptions yet scheduled</li>
<li>TWEAK: "Migrate" dialogue, when the Migrator is installed, now contains a widget to use directly (instead of just directing to other route)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Ask user to confirm if they navigate away from the settings page with unsaved changes</li>
<li>TWEAK: Replace some non-SSL links to updraftplus.com with SSL links, and replace all non-SSL readme links</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add UPDRAFTPLUS_DBSCAN_TIMEOUT constant to control how much time is allowed for scanning database, and make the default vary instead of constant (will help users with absolutely enormous databases).</li>
<li>TWEAK: Provide clearer guidance to users with a wrong updraftplus.com password entered for updates</li>
<li>TWEAK: When cloning a site with Jetpack, automatically clear Jetpack invalid connection status</li>
<li>TWEAK: Prevent some old admin notices from being repeated when saving settings</li>

<h4>1.9.64 - 2015-04-20</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: (Premium) Added wizard to make it easier to create limited-access AWS users (requires PHP 5.3.3)</li>
<li>SECURITY: Fix non-persistent back-end XSS vulnerability, reported by Sucuri - <a href="https://updraftplus.com/new-security-vulnerability-found-across-significant-numbers-of-wordpress-plugins-including-updraftplus/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/new-security-vulnerability-found-across-significant-numbers-of-wordpress-plugins-including-updraftplus/</a></li>
<li>FIX: Fix failure to access some files (e.g. for downloading or deleting) in Google Drive folders that contained &#62;100 UpdraftPlus backup archives (thanks to IanUK for his help)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Amazon S3 reduced redundancy storage (a feature of UpdraftPlus Premium) now requires use of PHP 5.3.3 or later.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Various fixes to bring automatic backups code up to date with WP 4.2 release candidate 1 (there were some changes since beta 3, which worked since UD 1.9.62)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Update to version 2.0 of plugin updater class (<a href="https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker</a>) - necessary on WP 4.2 to prevent shiny updates after the first failing when 3rd party plugins exist, and to suppress a PHP notice on the plugins page.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add wp_rp_tags to the list of potentially huge tables that won't need search/replacing</li>
<li>TRANSLATION: New Slovenian translation, courtesy of Clav Icula</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.63 - 2015-04-03</h4>

<ul>
<li>TWEAK: Revert to previous global SSL CA bundle: it seems Amazon S3 still has servers with 1024-bit SSL certificates</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.62 - 2015-04-01</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: Automatic backups now integrate with the forthcoming WP 4.2's "shiny plugin updates"</li>
<li>COMPATIBILITY: Tested and marked compatible with the forthcoming WordPress 4.2 (tested up to beta 3)</li>
<li>FIX: Fix regression in 1.9.60 for corner-case of S3 users with no permission to check their bucket's location (but permission to write to it).</li>
<li>TWEAK: Make "settings saved" message disappear after a few seconds, to prevent UI clutter</li>
<li>TWEAK: Decrease UI clutter in backup time selection</li>
<li>TWEAK: Update to latest global SSL CA bundle, removing again 1024-bit root CAs (last attempted in 1.9.26, but S3 still had some legacy servers). Modern web browsers have not accepted these for 6 months now. (SSL verification can be turned off in the expert options).</li>
<li>TWEAK: Defeat WP Download Manager Google Drive plugin's loading of its SDK on all pages (conflicting with UD when UD attempts to backup to Google Drive)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Detect case of old MySQL on Windows with table prefix that varies by case (and hence WP actually only works by accident) - produce a consistent backup that can be restored on any MySQL server.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add dashboard notice with links to more resources, for free users who've been installed &#62;4 weeks (with option to dismiss notice)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add itsec_log to the list of tables of non-essential/not-needing-search/replace + likely to be large tables for backup strategy</li>
<li>TWEAK: Improvement to scheduling algorithm in case where WP's scheduler starts same resumption multiple times - prevent next attempt being delayed longer than necessary</li>

<li>TWEAK: Tweak debug output of webserver information to avoid triggering a (silly) mod_security rule in some setups</li>
<li>TWEAK: Alert the user if using Amazon S3 if they do not have the PHP XML Writer module available</li>
<li>TWEAK: Log the fact that local deletions are being skipped, if the user set that option.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Give timestamp of WPB2D backups without relying upon location of SQL file</li>
<li>TWEAK: Detect a situation on migration where the uploads path is changed (from a site that began pre-WP 3.5) that was previously undetected</li>
<li>TRANSLATIONS: French translation updated from less than half to complete, thanks to Erwan Fran&#231;ois. Various other translations updated (many thanks to all translators).</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.60 - 2015-02-24</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: When using "Backup Now", and keeping the UpdraftPlus settings page open, a broken WP scheduler will not prevent the backup's progress.</li>
<li>FEATURE: Amazon's "EU Central 1" Frankfurt region now supported again (Amazon began requiring their new signature method at this location - probably a sign of things to come everywhere). PHP 5.3.3 required for this region.</li>
<li>FEATURE: Database backup files can now be handled when uncompressed - i.e., you can remove the gzip compression, and use the resulting file (useful for large backups on slow/limited hosting: pre-decompressing the file will reduce the processing time needed)</li>
<li>FEATURE: Introduced new in-page auto-backup widget that can resume, and thus cope with a backup of any size. This feature is in preparation of WP 4.2's major re-write of the updating user experience flow.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Update PHP-Opencloud (Rackspace) and dependency libraries to current versions.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Make sure that activity is recorded periodically when adding database tables to the final database backup (found a site with over 7,500 tables)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Don't bother to attempt to detect double-gz compression on setups where it can't be handled (where gzseek() has been disabled in the PHP configuration)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Added free/Premium comparison table to the free version</li>
<li>TWEAK: Importer (part of UpdraftPlus Premium) can now import generic .sql, .sql.gz and .sql.bz2 files</li>
<li>TWEAK: Don't show the "memory limit" warning in a case where the value could not be accurately detected</li>
<li>TWEAK: If the user chooses the "email" remote storage method, then a warning will be added if the archive being sent is bigger than most mailservers can carry (and will be removed if it is successfully sent), thus giving the user a hint as to the failure cause (if they overlooked the existing warning in the email settings).</li>
<li>TWEAK: The importer (part of UpdraftPlus Premium) can now import the latest BackupWordPress format databases</li>
<li>TWEAK: Flush output buffer explicitly when closing the browser connection - prevents delayed feedback on some setups</li>
<li>TWEAK: Automatic backups are now offered if you go to the 'Plugins' page, and update via the 'More information' iframe</li>
<li>TWEAK: Trim spaces from Google Drive client_id/secret - some users didn't spot that they introduced whitespace when copy-pasting</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add "Simple Visitor Stats" and "Simple Feed Stats" tables to the list of tables that may have large amounts of data, and which don't need search/replacing when migrating</li>
<li>TWEAK: When restoring plugins and themes, log the list of entities being restored (helps with tracing problems)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Deal with CloudFTP/StorageMadeEasy returning directory listings in a non-standard format, when rescanning remote backups</li>
<li>TWEAK: Version numbering scheme for paid versions changed; see: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/change-in-updraftpluss-version-numbering-scheme-for-paid-versions/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/change-in-updraftpluss-version-numbering-scheme-for-paid-versions/</a></li>
<li>TRANSLATIONS: Updated translations in several languages (many thanks for our translators)</li>
<li>FIX: For imported 3rd-party backups, the 'Existing Backups' tab (only) was showing "Unknown Source" instead of the detected source.</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.52 - 2015-02-07</h4>

<ul>
<li>FIX: Fix issue when migrating (hence, in Premium versions only) backups with very large options tables output by mysqldump, which could cause the site URL to finish with an incorrect value</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.51 - 2015-02-03</h4>

<ul>
<li>SECURITY: Prevent nonce leak that could allow logged-in users who aren't admins (if you have any) to access backups, UpdraftPlus settings and perform other harmful actions. No issue exists for users of UpdraftPlus Premium, or if you have the stand-alone "Automatic Backups" or "No Adverts" add-ons, or if your site has no untrusted users who can log in (or whilst have dismissed the "Automatic Backups" notice on the updates page). Credit to Sucuri (<a href="http://sucuri.net" rel="nofollow">http://sucuri.net</a>) for identifying this issue, and notifying us of it.</li>
</ul>

<li>TWEAK: Prevent a "not tested on this version of WP" message showing for a short time after install of a new version, when it only applied to the previous version</li>
<li>TWEAK: Reduce HTTP timeout when checking for available plugin updates (paid versions) from 10 to 5 seconds</li>
<li>TWEAK: Tidy up the post-restore screen a little - one less info box.</li>
<li>TWEAK: When a restore finishes, WP Super Cache's cache will be emptied (if present), to prevent confusion caused by cached pre-restore pages.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Slight change to how the 'mothership' for updates is calculated, for more flexibility in our in-house testing</li>
<li>TWEAK: Log more informative error if user chooses 'FTP' for their remote storage, but adds no FTP settings</li>
<li>TWEAK: Change "any other directory" to "any other file/directory" in the "more files" add-on, to better reflect its capabilities</li>
<li>TWEAK: Make sure that "more files" will skip UD's temporary directory, if asked to back up a parent directory of it</li>
<li>TWEAK: Default to https for updates checking, with fallback to http (only relevant to versions from updraftplus.com)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Prevent 'Strict Standards' PHP coding notice with WebDAV on PHP 5.5</li>
<li>TWEAK: Provide clickable link through to the admin email address in the reporting settings</li>
<li>TWEAK: If the gzopen or gzread functions are disabled in the PHP install, then the message saying so omitted to say which one (or both)</li>
<li>FIX: WebDAV upload method could very occasionally fail to detect upload error conditions</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.46 - 2014-12-29</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: Chunked/resumable uploads are now supported for SFTP</li>
<li>FIX: Scan for existing backup sets added manually to local storage in recent versions could overlook some unless clicked twice, in non-GMT timezones</li>
<li>TWEAK: Work-around issue in Manage WP worker plugin which caused a crash when authenticating with Dropbox</li>
<li>TWEAK: Prevent PHP notice when listing files on SFTP server</li>
<li>TWEAK: Reset an internal upload counter used to detect activity when a cloud storage switch is made due to no apparent activity - could prevent some large, long-running uploads on hosts with little available execution time</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.45 - 2014-12-20</h4>

<ul>
<li>FIX: Fix case in which the database imported from a BackWPUp backup could be falsely identified as missing (introduced in 1.9.40)</li>
<li>FIX: WordPress installs with ALTERNATE_WP_CRON set could skip some scheduled backups (since 1.9.19, so it appears that the conditions required to cause this bug are rare)</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.44 - 2014-12-13</h4>

<ul>
<li>TRANSLATIONS: Add new incomplete translations (ready for the wordpress.org change to take translation availability into account when searching for plugins): Norwegian Bokm&#229;l, Norwegian Nynorsk, Finnish, Hebrew, Catalan, Vietnamese, Bengali</li>
<li>FIX: Fix a failure to detect the progress properly for large backup sets, introduced in 1.9.40</li>
</ul>

15th 2014)</li>
<li>TWEAK: When an invalid JSON response is received during restore stage 2,
display the data directly (not just in the error console, where not everyone
will think of looking).</li>
<li>TWEAK: 3rd party backups which are missing expected entities are now handled
more gracefully</li>
<li>TWEAK: The fancy report now tells the user what paths are in the zips for
any additional paths they configured to add to the backup</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add a swifter resumption in one corner case (efficiency)</li>
<li>TWEAK: If a zip error is encountered on cPanel, then the free disk space is
checked, to potentially give the user more information on probable causes</li>
<li>TWEAK: You can now remove your updraftplus.com password from the settings
(paid version) without losing your access to updates</li>
<li>TWEAK: Suppress top advert if the user is on their first go (free version -

<h4>1.9.26 - 2014/09/22</h4>

<ul>
<li>TWEAK: There are still some Amazon S3 servers validated via a Verisign
1024-bit certificate, causing backup to fail due to SSL validation failure.

<h4>Can UpdraftPlus do (something)?</h4>

<p>Check out <a href="https://updraftplus.com/updraftplus-full-feature-list/">our full list of features</a>, and our <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">add-ons shop</a> and <a href="https://updraftplus.com/comparison-updraftplus-free-updraftplus-premium/">free/Premium comparison table</a>.</p>

<h4>I found a bug. What do I do?</h4>

<p>Note - this FAQ is for users of the free plugin. If you're a paying customer, then you should go here: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/support/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/support/</a> - please don't ask question in the WordPress.Org forum about purchases, as that's against their rules.</p>

<p>Next, please make sure you read this FAQ through - it may already have the answer you need. If it does, then please consider a donation (e.g. buy our "No Adverts" add-on - <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">https://updraftplus.com/shop/</a>); it takes time to develop this plugin and FAQ.</p>

<p>If it does not, then contact us (<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/updraftplus">the forum is the best way</a>)! This is a complex backup plugin and the only way we can ensure it's robust is to get bug reports and fix the problems that crop up. Please make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin, and that you include the version in your bug report - if you are not using the latest, then the first thing you will be asked to do is upgrade.</p>

<p>Please include the backup log if you can find it (there are links to download logs on the UpdraftPlus settings page; or you may be emailed it; failing that, it is in the directory wp-content/updraft, so FTP in and look for it there). If you cannot find the log, then I may not be able to help so much, but you can try - include as much information as you can when reporting (PHP version, your blog's site, the error you saw and how you got to the page that caused it, any other relevant plugins you have installed, etcetera). <a href="http://pastebin.com" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com</a> is a good place to post the log.</p>

<p>If you know where to find your PHP error logs (often a file called error_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory (check via FTP)), then that's even better (don't send multi-megabytes; just send the few lines that appear when you run a backup, if any).</p>

<p>If you are a programmer and can debug and send a patch, then that's even better.</p>

<h4>Anything essential to know?</h4>

<p>After you have set up UpdraftPlus, you must check that your WordPress backups are taking place successfully. WordPress is a complex piece of software that runs in many situations. Don't wait until you need your backups before you find out that they never worked in the first place. Remember, there's no warranty and no guarantees - this is free software.</p>

<h4>My enormous website is hosted by a dirt-cheap provider who starve my account of resources, and UpdraftPlus runs out of time! Help! Please make UpdraftPlus deal with this situation so that I can save two dollars!</h4>

<p>UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right from the beginning, so that it does not need to do everything in a single go; but this has limits. If your website is huge and your web hosting company gives your tiny resources on an over-loaded server, then go into the "Expert settings" and reduce the size at which zip files are split (versions 1.6.53 onwards). UpdraftPlus is known to successfully back up websites that run into the multiple-gigabytes on web servers that are not resource-starved.</p>

<h4>My site was hacked, and I have no backups! I thought UpdraftPlus was working! Can I kill you?</h4>

<p>No, there's no warranty or guarantee, etc. It's completely up to you to verify that UpdraftPlus is creating your backups correctly. If it doesn't then that's unfortunate, but this is a free plugin.</p>

<h4>I am not running the most recent version of UpdraftPlus. Should I upgrade?</h4>

<p>Yes; especially before you submit any support requests.</p>

</ol>";s:9:"changelog";s:58531:"<h4>2.0.12</h4>

<ul>
<li>Add option to center form on page</li>
<li>Improve styling classes for more consistency across different field classes, and make all classes responsive</li>
<li>Added a few more styling classes: frm_three_fourths, frm_two_fifths, frm_three_fifths</li>
<li>Remove in-place-editing from the field keys on the form builder page</li>
<li>Add 'frm_after_update_field_name' hook for changing a field name during editing</li>
<li>Update Bootstrap multiselect to v0.9.13</li>
<li>Add license page to prepare for add-ons. Big things are coming.</li>
<li>Fix: Prevent loading icon from being huge in some themes</li>
<li>Fix: When the jQuery UI css is loaded by another plugin on the form builder page, the required icon looked the same whether required or not. This styling conflict is resolved.</li>
<li>Fix: Make sure the form description size can be changed in the styling settings.</li>
<li><strong>Pro Features:</strong></li>
<li>Views can now be filtered by fields in the repeating sections.</li>
<li>Added [parent_id] shortcode for use in views. This shortcode will only have a value when the displaying entries in repeating sections.</li>
<li>Allow views to be created using the repeated entries. Since each repeating row is an entry in a hidden form, we can allow views to be created using those repeating rows for more flexability.</li>
<li>Added order parameter to frm-entry-links</li>
<li>Allow options in a post status field to come from the form builder. The options should have separate values and the saved values can include 'publish', 'draft', 'private', 'scheduled'.</li>
<li>Remove the option to lock field and form keys. This is more of a hassle than a feature.</li>
<li>Allow the entry key to be used with the frm-field-value shortcode instead of forcing the entry</li>
<li>Replaced inline 50px height for image fields with .frm_image_from_url class for easier control</li>
<li>Improve file upload field in Chrome to prevent extra space from showing.</li>
<li>Added 'frm_save_post_name' filter. This can be used for custom form actions that create posts.</li>
<li>Added 'frm_display_data_opts' filter.</li>
<li>Prevent frm_display_id custom field from saving when a field is selected in the create post settings instead of customized content</li>
<li>Fix: When forms were submitted without ajax, the redirect wasn't working consistently.</li>
<li>Fix: The shortcodes weren't processing in the message shown after an entry is updated. </li>
<li>Fix: When we prevented the PayPal action from triggering on import, we stopped all actions. This is now fixed so an action can be set (in the code) to be triggered on import. Posts will now be created on import again.</li>
<li>Fix: The dynamic list field was showing the entry ID in the entries tab instead of the value.</li>
<li>Fix: The Add row button wasn't showing in a repeating section when returning to edit an entry if there were more than two rows in the section.</li>
<li>Fix: Improve dropping a field between two sections.</li>
<li>Fix: Remove nonce check for frm-entry-update-field shortode. Page caching gives front-end nonce checks issues.</li>
<li>Fix: We changed the parameters sent to the frm_after_update_field hook without realizing it. The 'field_id' attribute was sometimes an object, but was previously always an integer. This has been updated for reverse compatibility, and 'field' has been added with the full field object.</li>
<li>Fix: If you put -100 for the start date in a date field, -100 would show in the date field instead of 1915. This is now working correctly for dynamic values like this with three digits.</li>
<li>Fix: When filtering a view with a Dynamic field, NOT EQUAL TO will work correctly.</li>
<li>Fix: Double quotes were causing trouble when included inside an error message returned by the frm_validate_field_entry hook</li>
<li>Fix: Graphs using x_axis and start_date were having trouble</li>
<li>Fix: The js error after selecting an option in autocomplete field is fixed when there are calculations in the form.</li>

<p>A. Try the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Double check to make sure your email address is present and correct in the "Emails" tab on the form "Settings" page</li>
<li>Make sure you are receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password...)</li>
<li>Check your SPAM box</li>
<li>Try a different email address.</li>
<li>Install WP Mail SMPT or another similar plugin and configure the SMTP settings</li>
<li>If none of these steps fix the problem, let us know and we'll try to help you find the bottleneck.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Q. How do I edit the field name?</h4>

<p>A. The field and form names and descriptions are all changed with in-place edit. Just click on the text you would like to change, and it will turn into a text field.</p>

<h4>Q. Why isn't the form builder page working after I updated?</h4>

<p>A. Try clearing your browser cache. As plugin modifications are made, frequent javascript and stylesheet changes are also made. However, the previous versions may be cached so you aren't using the modified files. After clearing your cache and you're still having issues, please let us know.</p>

</ul>

<h4>6.3.3</h4>

</ul>

<h4>6.1.1</h4>

<ul>
<li>Due to many questions about tracking code placement, <a href="http://forums.ronaldheft.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&#38;t=967">an FAQ article</a> has been written to address these placement questions. If you have any questions, this is a recommended read.</li>
<li>Corrects issues related to selecting user roles to exclude from tracking / seeing the dashboard widget.</li>
<li>Cleans up the display of user role names for WordPress versions below WordPress 3.0.</li>
<li>Updates the included jQuary Sparkline library to 1.5.1, thus adding support for viewing the dashboard graph in all versions of Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>Adds two hooks, google_analyticator_extra_js_before and google_analyticator_extra_js_after, enabling other WordPress plugins to insert additional tracking code.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6.1</h4>

<ul>
<li>Prepares Google Analyticator for WordPress 3.0 compatibility.</li>
<li>Updates the async tracking snippet to the latest version provided by Google. This new update solves issues with IE7 and IE6, and fixes all problems related to the snippet being placed in the  section of a page. You can rest easy knowing that async tracking in the  is completely compatible with IE now.</li>
<li>Adds an html comment to the page header when tracking code is hidden due to the user admin level. This should make is less confusing for new Google Analyticator users, wondering if their tracking code is visible to the world.</li>
<li>Adds a setting to specify a specific profile ID. This will help users with multiple Analytics profiles, by allowing them to specify which profile to use with the dashboard widget.</li>

<h4>6.0</h4>

<ul>
<li>Switches current tracking script (ga.js) to the new awesome async tracking script.

<li>Removes settings made obsolete due to the new async tracking (footer tracking and http/https).</li>
<li>Fixes the (not set) pages in the Top Pages section of the dashboard widget. Pages containing the title (not set) will be combined with the correct page and corresponding title. Note that I am still trying to get this bug fixed in the Google Analytics API; this is just a hold over until the bug is fixed.</li>
<li>Adds a link to Google Analytics on the dashboard widget for quick access to view full stat reports.</li>
<li>Fixes a Javascript error that prevented the dashboard widget from collapsing.</li>

<li>Updates the included jQuery sparklines plugin to the latest version, 1.4.3.</li>
<li>Adds an experimental function to retrieve page visitors stats for theme developers. This function is not final and only provided for advanced users who know what they're doing. Future versions will improve on the code already in place. Find the get_analytics_visits_by_page in google-analyticator.php to learn how to use. Use at your own risk.</li>
<li>Fixes several security flaws identified during a recent security audit of Google Analyticator.</li>
<li>Removes references to Spiral Web Consulting. Google Analyticator is now being developed exclusively by Ronald Heft.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WordPress v4.3 Compat./Bug Fix</strong> This release of s2Member alters the way New User Notification Emails are sent, and in how they should be formatted in WordPress v4.3+.</p>

<p>The New User Notification Email is now sent (to a user) only if they did <em>not</em> set a Custom Password during their registration; i.e., only if they need this email to set their password for the first time. In short, s2Member now follows the same approach used by WordPress v4.3+.</p>

<p>See:  <strong>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member  &#8594; General Options &#8594; Email Configuration &#8594; New User Notification</strong></p>

<p>So the purpose of this particular email has changed just a bit; i.e., the New User Notification Email. Instead of it being sent to every new user, it is only sent to users who need it for the purpose of obtaining a password which grants them access to their account for the first time.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrading to WordPress v4.3 and the latest release of s2Member?</strong></p>

<p>Please review this section of your Dashboard carefully:
<strong>s2Member  &#8594; General Options &#8594; Email Configuration &#8594; New User Notification</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using s2Member to customize the New User Notification email, you should try to update this message so that it includes the new <code>%%wp_set_pass_url%%</code> Replacement Code.</li>
</ul>

<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode that was causing <code>levels="0"</code> not to work, and in fact any use of a <code>0</code> in the <code>levels=""</code> attribute was broken. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/663">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond for reproducing, reporting and testing this issue.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Emoji Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in s2Member's SSL filters that can be applied with the Post/Page Custom Field <code>s2member_force_ssl</code> being set to <code>yes</code>. A symptom of this bug was to see an SSL warning in the latest release of WordPress related to the new Emoji library. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/674">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>v150722</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>New Shortcode:</strong> This release introduces a powerful new shortcode which allows you to display a user's EOT (End of Term) or NPT (next payment time) in a WordPress Post or Page. For further details and some minor limitations, please see <a href="http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2eot-shortcode-documentation/"><code>[s2Eot /]</code> Shortcode Documentation</a>. Props to @raamdev and @patdumond for their strategic assistance, feedback, and ideas for this shortcode.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Strong Password Enforcement:</strong> This release of s2Member makes it possible for a site owner to enforce strong passwords; i.e., to require a minimum number of characters and a specific strength (i.e., mix of required characters). The default minimum length in s2Member changed from <code>6</code> to <code>8</code> characters minimum. The default password strength minimum is <code>good</code>. To customize, please see: <strong>s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; Registration/Profile Fields &#38; Options</strong>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/573">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond and @KTS915 for ideas and feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>reCAPTCHA v2 Upgrade:</strong> This release of s2Member comes with an updated reCAPTCHA&#8482; integration in order to take advantage of No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA and other enhancements provided by the v2 update on Google's end.</p>

<p><em>Existing s2Member installations that already have an old set of reCAPTCHA v1 Public/Private keys will continue to function as before. However, it is suggested that you configure reCATPCHA v2 keys in order to put s2Member Pro-Forms into the v2 mode moving forward. Please see: <strong>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; CAPTCHA Anti-Spam Security</strong> where you will find instructions.</em></p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>PayPal IPN Compat.</strong> This release addresses a problem with IPN connection failures that result in a 500 Internal Server Error on the PayPal side; occurring whenever s2Member attempts to verify IPN data. Please see: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/610">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in Stripe Pro-Form Checkout Options, where a Free Registration option could cause other paid Checkout Options to result in a checkout error under the right conditions. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/569">this GitHub issue</a> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>Google Analytics Compat.</strong> This release automatically preserves <code>utc_</code> variables that are used by Google Analytics whenever a Membership Options Page redirection occurs. i.e., if a visitor comes to the site with <code>utc_</code> variables and is redirected to the Membership Options Page, because the content they were trying to access is protected; the <code>utc_</code> variables are preserved during this redirection, and delivered as part of the Membership Options Page redirect.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net Endpoint Filters:</strong> This release adds two new WordPress Filters (i.e., Hooks) that can be used by developers in certain rare cases. Hook names are <code>ws_plugin__s2member_pro_authnet_aim_endpoint_url</code> and <code>ws_plugin__s2member_pro_authnet_arb_endpoint_url</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/575#issuecomment-104077606">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details and a quick example of use.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net AIM Compat.:</strong> This release addresses a compatibility issue that came to light recently, which was actually attributed to a bug in s2Member Pro that has been sliding through unnoticed until now. The format for an expiration date sent to the Authorize.Net AIM API should be <code>MM-YYYY</code>. The format for ARB API calls is <code>YYYY-MM</code>. s2Member Pro was sending <code>YYYY-MM</code> to both APIs. Fixed in this release. Props to @raamdev for investigating this. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/576">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug:</strong> This release corrects an issue in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode that was preventing the <code>display_name</code> DB column from being searchable. This release also adds the <code>display_name</code> to the list of default <code>search_columns=""</code> that are considered by the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode. Props to @patdumond for researching this. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/578">this GitHub issue</a> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects an issue where s2Member would fail to subscribe customers to configured mailing list IDs whenever an existing customer is upgrading and you have the Double Opt-In Checkbox turned off entirely. Fixed. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/581">this GitHub issue</a> if you would like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in s2Member's Stripe Pro-Forms, related to having multiple Checkout Options. The bug resulted in a missing error message whenever one of the Checkout Options was submitted incorrectly, and also resulted in the default Checkout Option being magically selected instead of the one that a customer was working with. Props to @patdumond and @bryanthankins. See: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/586">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release fixes an issue where the s2Drip shortcode was requiring PHP 5.3+; this fix allows the shortcode to work properly with PHP 5.2+.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Compat.</strong> A call to <code>WP_Widget</code> was updated to support WordPress v4.3+. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/607">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in the s2Member IPN handler that processes full refunds. In your s2Member EOT Behavior options, if you choose the  <code>refunds,partial_refunds,reversals</code> option it results in a full refund not being processed; i.e., an EOT does not occur as expected. s2Member was incorrectly recording that your configured preference was not to process refunds whenever a full refund occurs. Fixed in this release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/614">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Wikpedia Links:</strong> Updated throughout to use an <code>https://</code> protocol. Now the Wikipedia default. This impacts mostly the back-end of s2Member which references a few articles at the Wikipedia. However, it also impacts Pro-Forms where a link is provided to users with more information about Security Codes that appear on the back of credit cards. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/617">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>qTranslate X Compat.</strong> This release includes a minor update that improves compatibility with qTranslate X. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/618">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>AWeber Compat.</strong> This release resolves an issue with AWeber rejecting subscribers that have IPv6 addresses. Until such time as AWeber adds support for IPv6 addresses, s2Member will simply send an empty IP address whenever it encounters an IPv6 address. This behavior was requested by the AWeber team. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/611">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Expiration:</strong> This release improves the way coupons that are set to expire are handled. Instead of expiring at midnight the day before the configured  expiration date, coupon codes now expire at the end of the configured day. As always, all times are calculated from GMT/UTC time, the same as WordPress itself. In short, if you set a coupon to expire Dec 5th, the coupon will now expire Dec 5th, at the end of the day (UTC time). The old behavior, was for the coupon to expire Dec 4th at midnight UTC time, which led to confusion in many cases. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/612">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>IPN Proxy Key Bug:</strong> This release corrects a minor bug in s2Member's IPN Proxy Key generation that was causing problems in just a few edge cases. This bug may have impacted your site if you had a domain name being accessed with a <code>Host:</code> header containing mixed caSe. Not normal behavior, but there are a few edge cases where it's important for s2Member to get this right in order to avoid an "Unable to verify $_POST vars." error. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/590">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Password Reset Layout:</strong> This release improves the layout/CSS applied to the WordPress password reset form in order to better separate the password strength indicator from the instructions provided by WordPress. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/585">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond, @BugRat, and @raamdev for discovering this.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member) <strong>Back-end UI Quick Links:</strong> This release resolves an overlap in the display of the quick links atop each menu page in the Dashboard. This bug impacted the lite version only. If you'd like additional details, please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/589">this GitHub issue</a>. Props to @raamdev for discovering this.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Username Compat.:</strong> This release updates s2Member's own validation against usernames in order to bring it inline with the most recent versions of WordPress core; i.e., we now allow whitespace in usernames. This release was updated so that usernames are validated only by the WordPress core function: <code>sanitize_user()</code>, which does allow single whitespace characters in usernames. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/566">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Message After Modification:</strong> This release improves the default response that a customer who is upgrading/downgrading receives after having completed checkout using a Pro-Form. Instead of asking the customer to "log back in", s2Member simply says, "Thank you. Your account has been updated.". There is no reason for a customer to log back in; i.e., this is not necessary, and that message was leading to some confusion. Note also that with Pro-Forms you can provide a Custom Return URL on Success using the <code>success=""</code> shortcode attribute. Thus, this message is simply a default. We suggest that you customize in all cases. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/580">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond for reporting this important issue.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Documentation Update:</strong> This releases improves the documentation for the <code>rrt=""</code> shortcode attribute in all Pro-Form implementations; e.g., PayPal Pro-Forms, Authorize.Net Pro-Forms, and Stripe Pro-Forms. The <code>rrt=""</code> attribute can be somewhat misleading, so we added the following: <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> If you don't offer a trial period; i.e., the first charge occurs when a customer completes checkout, you should set this to the number of additional payments, and NOT to the total number. For instance, if I want to charge the customer a total of 3 times, and one of those charges occurs when they complete checkout, I set should this to <code>rrt="2"</code> for a grand total of three all together.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects an issue with EOT calculations under a specific circumstance. If a customer registered on the site for free, and later made a purchase that included a free trial period, and they canceled within the trial period, the EOT was being incorrectly calculated based on the user's WordPress registration time instead of being based on the time that their trial began. This resulted in an immediate EOT (due to it being a date in the past), instead of being set to the end of the trial. Fixed in this release.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Documentation Update:</strong> This release replaces a specific symbol that has been used throughout the Dashboard with s2Member. Instead of the <code>⥱</code> symbol we are now using the more compatible <code>&#8594;</code> symbol instead. This is used to indicate a Dashboard path.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>E_NOTICE:</strong> Several <code>E_NOTICE</code>-level warnings were resolved in this release. Note that <code>E_NOTICE</code>-level warnings only show up in <code>WP_DEBUG</code> mode for developers, but they are frustrating nonetheless. Props to @raamdev for reporting some of these.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal Pro-Forms selling to customers who choose a Maestro/Solo card may experience problems in some circumstances. GBP currency conversion was partially failing due to a change in the underlying API that s2Member calls upon. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/605">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Opt-In Bug Fix:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects a bug that was causing members to be automatically unsubscribed from your mailing list whenever you choose to hide the Double Opt-In Box. A customer updating their profile later without this box, was being unsubscribed inadvertently. Fixed in this release. Props to @raamdev for his work in reproducing and reporting this bug. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/633">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Workaround:</strong> It came to our attention that some Stripe API calls that simply update the <code>name</code>, <code>address_state</code>, <code>address_zip</code>, and <code>address_country</code> for tax reporting purposes were resulting in a card decline even after Stripe approved the transaction. We suspect this is a bug in the Stripe API. It has been reported to Stripe. For now though, we are working around this issue by failing gracefully in such a scenario. This simple update is there only for tax reporting purposes, so if it fails it does not warrant a refusal to complete the transaction.m It is simply logged by s2Member for analysis. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/535">this GitHub issue</a> where a deeper investigation is underway for our next maintenance release.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe API Update:</strong> This release of s2Member takes advantage of the latest Stripe API version. Moving from <code>v2015-02-18</code> to <code>v2015-07-13</code>. See <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#api-changelog">this article at Stripe</a> if you'd like additional details. <em>Remember that s2Member's API calls to Stripe will always use this specific version of their API (<code>v2015-07-13</code>), even if your Stripe account is configured with an older default version. This is to ensure that s2Member works as intended for all site owners.</em></p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Prepaid Cards:</strong> This release makes it possible for site owners to reject prepaid cards if they choose to do so. Stripe has the ability to determine if a credit/debit card is backed by a prepaid funding source. If it is, you can choose to reject or allow this type of card. The default behavior is to accept it. See: <strong>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Stripe Options &#8594; Account Details &#8594; Reject or Allow Prepaid Cards</strong> for further details. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/505">this GiHub issue</a> if you'd like more information. Props to @raamdev for determining the feasibility of this feature.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> <code>Notice: Undefined index: password1</code> in <code>paypal-registration-in.inc.php</code>. This was another <code>E_NOTICE</code>-level warning that was cleaned up in this release. Props to @raamdev See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/634">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> This release fixes a bug in Stripe Pro-Forms where upon a customer applying a 100%-off coupon code, the customer is met with an erroneous error regarding a missing state/zipcode--and only when a site owner has defined a tax configuration file also. Fixed in this release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/548">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Automatic Update Compat.:</strong> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Configuring_Automatic_Background_Updates">Automatic Background Updates</a> were introduced in WordPress v3.7 and while by default only WordPress core updates are updated automatically in this special way, it's still possible to enable automatic background updates for everything; including themes and plugins. For instance, some web hosting companies enable automatic/background plugin updates in an attempt to improve overall security.</p>

<p>That's fine. However, when s2Member Pro is installed, it works as an add-on for the s2Member Framework plugin, and any update of the Framework plugin requires a manual or interactive update of the Pro add-on. Otherwise your site is left with only a portion of its original functionality until you complete the update. For that reason, starting with this release of s2Member, automatic background updates of the s2Member Framework are disabled automatically when you are also running s2Member Pro.</p>

<p>Props to @raamdev for addressing this issue and providing the source code which made this enhancement possible. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/523">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p>

<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WordPress v4.3-beta Compat.:</strong> This release was tested against WordPress v4.2+, including WordPress v4.3-beta. A few minor adjustments were made to improve support in the upcoming release of WordPress v4.3 based on beta releases made available to us.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>goo.gl URL Shortener:</strong> This release addresses a problem with the Google URL Shortening API. Google now requires that you configure an API key. Otherwise, API calls will fail often and s2Member reverts back to tinyURL instead. Starting with this release, if you enable the Google URL Shortener, you will need to supply an API key for it to work as expected. See: <strong>s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; URL Shortening Service Preference</strong> for further details. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/587">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @bridgeport for reproducing and reporting this bug.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bitly URL Shortener:</strong> This release adds support for Bitly to be used as your preferred URL Shortening service. Bitly has become very popular for many reasons. One reason to choose Bitly over others is that you can configure your Bitly account to use a custom domain of your choosing; i.e., shortened URLs may contain <a href="https://bitly.com/a/settings/advanced">a domain that you configure</a>. See: <strong>s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; URL Shortening Service Preference</strong> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Other Gateways:</strong> Starting with this release, when you install the s2Member Pro add-on for the first time, there are two Pro gateways enabled by default. When you first install s2Member Pro (first-time users only), both the Stripe and PayPal Pro payment gateways will already be enabled for you. This is to help site owners avoid confusion. In addition, first-time users will be greeted by s2Member Pro with a reminder to configure your "Other Gateways". See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/528">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @raamdev for identifying this usability issue and providing feedback/suggestions.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stats Collection:</strong> Starting w/ this release of s2Member Pro, we are now collecting important/anonymous server details that will help us better understand which versions of PHP/MySQL are most widely used by site owners running the pro version of our software. For further details, please see: <a href="http://s2member.com/kb-article/what-information-does-s2member-pro-report-to-websharks/">What anonymous information does s2Member Pro report to WebSharks, and why?</a></p></li>

<h4>v150311</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> The list of users in the WordPress Dashboard was going blank in a particular scenario where a search was attempted in concert with a sortable s2Member column. Fixed in this release. Props to @bridgeport for finding this. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/496#issuecomment-76821470">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug Fix:</strong> This release resolves an issue with pagination in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode after recent changes in the <code>WP_User_Query</code> class. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/493">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Remote Operations API (Bug Fix):</strong> If a remote API call was made to find a user by <code>user_login</code>, and that username was all numeric, the <code>WP_User</code> class treated it like a user ID instead of as an actual username. Resolved in this release by calling <code>new WP_User(0, [user login])</code> as the second argument to the constructor. Thereby forcing <code>WP_User</code> to consider it a username. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/498">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> Stripe Pro-Forms for Specific Post/Page Access should not disable the email address field for logged-in users. Resolved in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/500">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Pro-Forms:</strong> This release corrects a bug first introduced in the last release that prevented custom templates for Stripe Pro-Forms from working as intended. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/510">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix for Gift/Redemption Codes:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects a bug that impacted the generation of Gift/Redemption Codes whenever they were sold with Specific Post/Page Access.

<h4>v150225</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Accept Bitcoin via Stripe!</strong> This release of s2Member Pro comes integrated with the latest version of the Stripe API, where it is now possible to accept Bitcoin right along with most major credit cards&#8212;made possible by <a href="https://stripe.com/bitcoin">Stripe's latest update to support Bitcoin</a>. It's as easy as flipping a switch :-) Please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member Pro &#8594; Stripe Options &#8594; Account Details &#8594; Accept Bitcoin</code>. Referencing <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/482">this GitHub issue</a>; i.e., the original feature request.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe API Upgrade:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro updates the Stripe SDK and Stripe API to the latest version (Stripe API version: <code>2015-02-18</code>). In addition, this release forces a specific version of the Stripe API in all communication between Stripe and s2Member; thereby avoiding a scenario where the Stripe API could be updated again in the future, in ways that might prevent s2Member Pro from operating as intended. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/484">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details. Props to @pauloz1890 for reporting this.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Security Badge Sizes:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects an issue with the <code>[s2Member-Security-Badge v="1" /]</code> shortcode. If you set <code>v="2"</code> or <code>v="3"</code>, the dimensions were miscalculated. Props to @Mizagorn See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/pull/466">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Opt-in checkbox state (and some custom fields) were losing state when switching from one type of Pro Form to another&#8212;whenever Pro Form Checkout Options were in use. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/468">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @zenzoidman for finding this!</li>
<li>(s2Member) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Alt. View Restrictions stopped working on navigation menu items in the previous release of s2Member v150203 due to a default argument value being misinterpreted by a sub-routine. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/475">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Some site owners reported "paying" customers being left with a Membership Level of <code>0</code> at seemingly random times that may have occurred only once in every 300+ transactions. The issue was related to a regular expression being performed against encrypted binary data with an ungreedy <code>?</code> in the regex pattern. Certain characters in the binary output would be lost when specific character sequences were encountered; resulting in a random failure to decrypt cookies set by s2Member. In short, the underlying cause was identified and corrected in this release. Thanks to all who reported this. Our appreciation goes out to everyone who helped to test for this elusive bug. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/397">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>UI Enhancements:</strong> This release includes an enhanced UI, along with many subtle improvements to the inline documentation/instructions provided within the WordPress Dashboard.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Retiring Google Wallet:</strong> Google <a href="https://support.google.com/wallet/business/answer/6107573">announced that they are retiring Google Wallet for Digital Goods</a>. s2Member Pro continues to support Google Wallet, but this release updates the "Other Gateways" section in the Dashboard to make it clear that Google Wallet will not be supported in future versions of s2Member Pro. In fact, Google Wallet for Digital Goods will <a href="https://support.google.com/wallet/business/answer/6107573">close March 2nd, 2015</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>bbPress Bug Fix:</strong> This release resolves a security issue when running a Multisite Network with bbPress + s2Member. Level 0 access was being granted by the bbPress plugin across all sites in a network. That behavior is fine for bbPress, but is unexpected when s2Member is running in a Network environment. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/465">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. <strong>IMPORTANT TIP:</strong> If you experienced this issue, please read through <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/465#issuecomment-76039842">these important comments</a> about bbPress Participants needing to be removed from child blogs in order to fully rid yourself of this problem; i.e., once you complete the update of s2Member, you should <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/465#issuecomment-76039842">also read this please</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>404 / Alt. Views Bug Fix:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects a rare issue where the Membership Options Page (or other pages) can produce random 404 errors whenever s2Member's Alt. View Restrictions are enabled, and there is another plugin installed which runs a DB query using the <code>WP_Query</code> class <em>before</em> the Main WP Query has been run. Resolved through the use of <code>-&#62;is_main_query()</code> instead of tracking it statically via <code>$initial_query</code>.

</ul>

<h4>v150203</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Gift/Redemption Codes:</strong> This release adds a powerful new shortcode: <code>[s2Member-Gift-Codes /]</code>. This makes it easy to generate and sell access to gift codes (i.e., gift certificates) and/or to a list of redemption codes. For instance,  where a single team leader might like to purchase multiple accounts they can distribute to others on a team, or in a group. Video demo here: <a href="http://s2member.com/r/giftredemption-codes-video/" rel="nofollow">http://s2member.com/r/giftredemption-codes-video/</a> ~ See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/386">this GitHub issue</a> for additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>User-Specific Coupon Codes:</strong> This release of s2Member makes it possible to configure Pro-Form Coupon Codes that are connected (i.e., only valid) when entered by specific Users/Members who are logged into the site. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/403">this GitHub issue</a> for additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Max Uses:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro adds the ability to set a maximum number of times that a Coupon Code can be used. This makes it easy to create Coupon Codes that are designed to be used only one time, for instance; or for X number of times. After a Coupon Code is used X number of times, it will expire automatically. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Usage Tracking:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro adds the ability to track the number of times that each of your Coupon Codes have been used. It is also possible to alter the number of uses, and/or set a maximum number of uses. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Active/Expires Dates:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro makes it possible to establish both a start and end time for each of your Pro Coupon Codes. In previous versions of s2Member, it was only possible to set an expiration date. You can now create Coupon Codes that will become active at some point in the future automatically. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code UI Enhancements:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro comes with an updated UI that makes it easier to manage your Pro Coupon Codes. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Store Coupon Codes for Each User:</strong> s2Member Pro now stores a list of all coupon codes that a customer has used on your site. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; Users &#8594; Choose User [Edit]</code>. Scrolling down to the set of s2-related fields will reveal a new list of coupon codes. This list will be filled for new customers only; i.e., s2Member does not have this data for past purchases; only for new customers that you acquire after updating to the latest release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/462">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>EOT Custom Value:</strong> In this release of s2Member, the <code>get_user_option('s2member_custom')</code> value is preserved after an EOT has taken place, making it possible for site owners to continue to read this value (along with any custom pipe-delimited values they have injected there), even after an EOT has taken place. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/449">this GitHub issue</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>JW Player Broken Links:</strong> This release corrects some broken links referenced by the inline documentation for s2Member in the WordPress Dashboard. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/448">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Security:</strong> This release of s2Member checks for the existence of the WordPress PHP Constant: <code>WPINC</code> instead of looking for the less reliable <code>$_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']</code>. Some site owners reported this was causing trouble in a localhost environment during testing, or when running s2Member on some hosts that are missing the <code>SCRIPT_FILENAME</code> environment variable; e.g., some Windows servers. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/454">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Advanced Import/Export Compat:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro includes compatibility and a bug fix when running on WordPress v4.1+. Three PHP notices during importation, along with some quirky behavior associated with the <code>role</code> CSV column have been corrected. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/455">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug Fix:</strong> This release resolves an issue with pagination in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode after recent improvements to the search functionality. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/155#issuecomment-69403120">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Enhancement:</strong> This release improves search functionality in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode, making it so that all searches default to <code>*[query]*</code>; i.e., are automatically wrapped by wildcards. If a user enters a wildcard explicitly (or a double quote), this default behavior is overridden and the search query is taken as given in such a scenario. This makes the search functionality easier for end-users to work with, since it no longer requires an exact match. Default behavior is now a fuzzy match. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/394">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>AWS v4 Authentication:</strong> This release of s2Member adds AWS v4 Authentication support for Amazon Web Service Regions that only accept the AWS v4 authentication scheme. If you had trouble in the recent past when attempting to integrate s2Member with S3 Buckets (or with CloudFront) in regions outside the USA, this release should resolve those issues for you. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/440">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Pro-Form Checkout Options not working in all cases whenever they are used together with Free Registration Forms. Resolved in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h4>v150102</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Custom Field Mapping:</strong> This release of s2Member adds an internal mapping from s2Member's Custom Field values for each user, to the <code>get_user_option()</code> function in the WordPress core. This makes it possible to retrieve user custom field values like always via <code>get_user_field()</code> or now through the native <code>get_user_option()</code> function also. The benefit of this is that s2Member's custom fields are now more compatible with other themes/plugins for WordPress.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>[s2Member-List /] Shortcode:</strong> It is now possible to search through custom fields created with s2Member using the <code>search_columns=""</code> attribute; e.g., <code>search_columns="user_login,user_email,s2member_custom_field_MYFIELDID"</code>; where <code>MYFIELDID</code> can be replaced with a field ID that you generate with s2Member via <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; Registration/Profile Fields</code>. See also: <a href="http://www.s2member.com/kb/s2member-list-shortcode/">this KB article</a> for further details. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/155">this GitHub issue</a> for details regarding this improvement.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>MailChimp Bug Fix</strong> This release fixes a bug first introduced in the previous release, which was causing Interest Groups configured w/ s2Member to not be added properly. Resolved in this release. Props to @ethanpil Thanks!</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>ccBill Buttons</strong> This release updates all ccBill button graphics. The MasterCard logo has been removed, and a new set of buttons was created to improve upon the set provided in previous versions of s2Member Pro. See: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/392">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net</strong> The <code>AUD</code> currency code is now supported by Authorize.Net, and thus, s2Member Pro has been updated to support the <code>AUD</code> currency code for Pro-Forms integrated with Authorize.Net. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/383">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Subscr. CID for Stripe</strong> This release corrects a bug which made it impossible to update the Subscr. CID value (for Stripe) using the user edit form in the Dashboard. For further details, please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/380">this GitHub issue</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug fix</strong> s2Member's membership access times log was failing to collect all required access times under certain scenarios where multiple CCAPS were being added or removed in succession within the same process, but across multiple function calls. This resulted in unexpected behaviors (in rare cases) when attempting to use the <code>[s2Drip /]</code> shortcode. Fixed in this release. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/406">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Compatibility</strong> This release includes a fix for s2Member's Multisite Network patches applied to the <code>wp-admin/user-new.php</code> file whenever you configure s2Member on a Multisite Network. This change makes s2Member compatible with the coming release of WordPress v4.1 and v4.2-beta as it exists now. See: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/410">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> A feature that was previously introduced in v140816, which made it possible for site owners to set a failed payment threshold (in s2Member's Authorize.Net integration), was suffering from an off-by-one issue during total failed payment calculations. Fixed in this release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/416">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Feature Enhancement:</strong> Whenever a failed payment threshold is reached (in s2Member's Authorize.Net integration), not only will s2Member terminate on-site access, but now the underlying ARB (Automated Recurring Profile) is cancelled at the same exact time. This way future billing attempts on the Authorize.Net side will not be possible; i.e., it ensures that a failed payment threshold will always terminate both on-site access and the ARB itself together at the same time, as opposed to allowing the ARB termination to occur automatically via Authorize.Net, <em>whenever</em>. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/416">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>ClickBank Disclaimer:</strong> This release of s2Member adds a default Auto-Return Header Template (customizable from <code>s2Member &#8594; ClickBank Options</code> in the Dashboard) which includes a disclaimer that ClickBank requires of most merchants before final approval.</p>

<p><em>This default template should help to reduce the time it takes new merchants to receive final approval from ClickBank when first starting out in the ClickBank network. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/412">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</em></p></li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal Pro-Forms for Specific Post/Page Access, and configured with <code>accept="paypal"</code> (i.e., to accept PayPal only) were not hiding the entire Billing Method section as intended. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/399">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal Pro-Forms using Express Checkout for Billing Agreements under a non-native currency (i.e., under a different currency than their own PayPal account) were failing under some scenarios (notably with the <code>BRL</code> currency code). Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/414">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe API:</strong> s2Member's Stripe integration has been updated to use the new <code>statement_descriptor</code> field in favor of the now deprecated <code>statement_description</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/422">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> In the case of a global tax rate having been applied to the total cost, there were certain scenarios where s2Member Pro would kick back an error message, "Invalid Parameters to Stripe". Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/425">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WP Core Compat.:</strong> This version of s2Member forces the <code>wptexturize</code> filter off in WordPress, due to a bug that was introduced in recent versions of the WordPress core; which results in broken shortcodes in some scenarios. Until the underlying bug is fixed in the WP core, the <code>wptexturize</code> filter must be disabled to prevent corruption of any WordPress shortcode that may contain <code>&#60;</code> or <code>&#62;</code> symbols.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/349">this GitHub issue</a> for further technical details. Also referencing: <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29608">this WordPress core bug report</a>.</p></li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Alt. Views:</strong> This release fixes a bug that caused <code>wp_list_pages()</code> not to be filtered properly under certain scenarios. A symptom of this bug was to apply s2Member's Alt. View protection for "Pages", but for this not work properly in all cases. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/372">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Currency Code/Symbol:</strong> All email templates, API Notifications (except cancellation/EOT notifications), and all Custom Return URLs on Success; across all payment gateways; now support two additional Replacement Codes: <code>%%currency%%</code> and <code>%%currency_symbol%%</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/314">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Codes:</strong> All transaction-related email templates now support three additional Replacement Codes: <code>%%full_coupon_code%%</code>, <code>%%coupon_code%%</code>, and <code>%%coupon_affiliate_id%%</code>. These have been documented in your Dashboard in places where transaction-related email templates are configured. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/384">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Tax Info:</strong> s2Member now attaches metadata to Stripe Charges and to Stripe Subscriptions which includes a JSON-encoded object containing two or more properties when tax applies.</p>

<p>These metadata properties can be found in your Stripe Dashboard with the metadata key: <code>tax_info</code>; which contains the following JSON-encoded properties: <code>tax</code> (total tax that was or will be charged on the regular amount), <code>tax_per</code> (tax percentage rate that was applied based on your configuration of s2Member Pro); along with <code>trial_tax</code> and <code>trial_tax_per</code> in the case of a Stripe Subscription that includes an initial/trial period that requires payment; i.e., the tax applied (if any) to an initial/trial payment on a Subscription.</p>

<p>We hope this additional information being recorded by s2Member and stored securely within your Stripe account will make it easier for you to maintain accurate bookkeeping records moving forward. This additional metadata is generated for new customers only. It will not be backfilled for any past transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Tax Info:</strong> s2Member now passes the tax location; i.e., <code>address_state</code>, <code>address_zip</code>, and <code>address_country</code> to each Stripe Card object associated with a Stripe Customer.</p>

<p>We hope this additional information being recorded by s2Member and stored securely within your Stripe account will make it easier for you to maintain accurate bookkeeping records moving forward. This additional cardholder data is collected and stored for new customers only; it will not be backfilled for any past transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe IP Address:</strong> s2Member now attaches the customer's IP address (as detected via <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> on your server) into each Stripe Customer object, along with the customer's full name. These metadata properties can be found in your Stripe Dashboard with the metadata keys: <code>name</code> and <code>ip</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Coupon Code:</strong> s2Member now attaches metadata w/ a coupon code used by your customer (if applicable) to each Stripe Charge and/or Stripe Subscription object.</p>

<p>This metadata property can be found in your Stripe Dashboard with the metadata key: <code>coupon</code>; which contains the following JSON-encoded property: <code>code</code> i.e., the full coupon code used by your customer. This additional metadata is generated for new customers only. It will not be backfilled for any past transactions. Filled only for transactions that use a coupon code.</p></li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Invoice:</strong> This release corrects a bug in s2Member's Stripe integration whereby <code>subscr-signup-as-subscr-payment</code> was not always being forced into the core gateway processor; resulting in a miscalculation of the <code>last_payment_time</code> under certain scenarios. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/396">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
</ul>

<h4>v141007</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>ClickBank IPN v6:</strong> This release enables a new integration option for site owners integrated with ClickBank. You may now choose to integrate with v6 of ClickBank's IPN service, since all previous versions are slowly being phased out by ClickBank. Please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; ClickBank Options &#8594; IPN Integration</code> for v6 config. options. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/256">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details regarding this topic. See also: <a href="https://support.clickbank.com/entries/22803622-instant-notification-service">this article @ ClickBank</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>AWeber API Integration:</strong> This release of s2Member adds a new option for site owners using AWeber. It is now possible to integrate with the new <a href="http://www.s2member.com/r/aweber-api-key">s2Member App</a> for AWeber; i.e., via the AWeber API instead of via email-based communication. For further details, please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; API / List Servers &#8594; AWeber Integration</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/303">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> The EOT Behavior option for <code>refunds,partial_refunds,reversals</code> was not being accepted by s2Member. Fixed in this release. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/345">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>MailChimp API Wrapper:</strong> This release of s2Member comes with an updated API wrapper class for MailChimp integration. No change in functionality, just a smoother, slightly faster, and more bug-free interaction with the MailChimp API. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/303">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details regarding this improvement. See also: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mailchimp/mailchimp-api-php">the official MailChimp API class</a>; i.e., what s2Member has been updated to in this release.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>URI Restrictions caSe-insensitive (Security Fix)</strong> This release of s2Member changes the way URI Restrictions work. All URI Restrictions are now caSe-insensitive (i.e., <code>/some-path/</code> is now the same as <code>/some-Path/</code>), allowing s2Member to automatically pick up different variations used in attempts to exploit the behavior of certain slugs within the WordPress core. You can also change this new default behavior, if you prefer. Please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Restriction Options &#8594; URI Restrictions</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/354">this GitHub issue</a> for the details about why this was changed in the most recent copy of s2Member.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>AWeber Role-Based Emails:</strong> In this release we're adding a note in the s2Member UI regarding role-based email addresses being rejected by AWeber. AWeber does not allow role-based emails like: <code>admin@</code> or <code>webmaster@</code> to be subscribed. It is suggested that you enable s2Member's config. option: "Force Personal Emails" if you intend to integrate with AWeber. Please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; Registration/Profile Fields</code>; where you can tell s2Member for force personal email addresses when someone registers on-site. This will prevent a potential subscriber from entering something like <code><a href="mailto:admin@example.com">admin@example.com</a></code> as their email address.</li>

<h4>Don't risk your backups on anything less</h4>

<p>Your WordPress backups are worth the same as your entire investment in your website. The day may come when you get hacked, or your hosting company does, or they go bust - without good backups, you lose everything. Do you really want to entrust all your work to a backup plugin with only a few thousand downloads, or that has no professional backup or support? Believe us - writing a reliable backup plugin that works consistently across the huge range of WordPress deployments is hard.</p>

<h4>UpdraftPlus Premium</h4>

<p>UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore is not crippled in any way - it is fully functional for backing up and restoring your site. What we do have is various extra features (including site cloning), and guaranteed support, available <a href="https://updraftplus.com/">from our website, updraftplus.com</a>. See <a href="https://updraftplus.com/comparison-updraftplus-free-updraftplus-premium/">a comparison of the free/Premium versions, here</a>.</p>

<p>If you need WordPress multisite backup compatibility (you'll know if you do), <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">then you need UpdraftPlus Premium</a>.</p>

<h4>Professional / Enterprise support agreements available</h4>

<p>UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore is written by professional WordPress developers. If your site needs guaranteed support, then we are available. Just  <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">go to our shop.</a></p>

<h4>More premium plugins</h4>

<p>If you are in the market for other WordPress premium plugins (especially WooCommerce addons), then try our shop, here: <a href="https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/" rel="nofollow">https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/</a></p>

<h4>Are you multi-lingual? Can you translate?</h4>

<p>Are you able to translate UpdraftPlus into another language? Are you ready to help speakers of your language? UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore itself is ready and waiting - the only work needed is the translating. The translation process is easy, and web-based - go here for instructions: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/translate/">https://updraftplus.com/translate/</a>. (Or if you're an expert WordPress translator already, then just pick out the .pot file from the wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/languages/ directory - if you scan for translatable strings manually, then you need to get these functions: _x(), __(), _e(), _ex(), log_e()).</p>

<p>Many thanks to the existing translators - listed at: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/translate/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/translate/</a></p>

<p>N.B. Paid versions of UpdraftPlus Backup / Restore have a version number which is 1 higher in the first digit, and has an extra component on the end, but the changelog below still applies. i.e. changes listed for 1.11.4 of the free version correspond to changes made in 2.11.4.x of the paid version.</p>

<h4>1.11.5 - 22/Aug/2015</h4>

<ul>
<li>FIX: phpseclib fix relating to generation of random numbers on some systems (affecting SFTP on some systems)</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.11.4 - 19/Aug/2015</h4>

<ul>
<li>FIX: Perform previously missing tweak on the database after restoring a multisite backup to an install with a different table prefix, which inhibited the ability to create new users on the main site in a network.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Remove an inefficiency when examining files to prune from Google Drive, reducing the amount of time needed.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Show a warning if UpdraftPlus's directory in wp-content/plugins has been manually renamed to include a space, which WordPress does not support</li>
<li>TWEAK: Skip search/replacing of the 'guid' column in the posts table when migrating (improves performance - and prevents possible re-appearances of blog articles in peoples' feed readers if double-migrating)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Upgraded the bundled phpseclib Math, Net and File libraries to current versions (1.0 branch)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Prevent PHP notice in log file when deleting FTP backup from dashboard</li>
<li>TRANSLATIONS: Updated translations, including Greek</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.11.3 - 13/Aug/2015</h4>

<ul>
<li>FIX: Fix access to S3 for PHP 5.2 users using buckets in the US-WEST-1 region</li>
<li>FIX: Fix access to UpdraftPlus Vault for some PHP 5.2 users</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.11.2 - 11/Aug/2015</h4>

<ul>
<li>TWEAK: Handle the results when someone with no UpdraftPlus Vault quota attempts to connect more gracefully</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.11.1 - 10/Aug/2015</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: UpdraftPlus Vault storage - simple to set up storage from your trusted provider: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/landing/vault" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/landing/vault</a> - with 1Gb of free storage for UpdraftPlus Premium customers ( <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftplus-premium/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftplus-premium/</a> ) - and more storage available for anyone to purchase. All other storage options (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) remain available, of course!</li>
<li>FEATURE: S3 enhanced wizard now allows the user to optionally deny the new Amazon Web Services IAM user download and/or delete permissions, for an even more secure setup (at the cost of some convenience - you will need to download/restore/delete S3 backups outside of UpdraftPlus).</li>
<li>FEATURE: Amazon S3 in UpdraftPlus Premium now supports optional server-side encryption</li>
<li>FEATURE: An "UpdraftPlus" menu now appears on the WP admin bar, allowing quick access.</li>
<li>COMPATIBILITY: Tested and compatible with WordPress 4.3</li>
<li>SPEED: For users' whose backups are created with a zip binary (the default engine, where available), CPU usage + zip creation times have been significantly reduced</li>
<li>SPEED: For users cloning a website with a large number of users and a changed table prefix, a long and slow series of SQL operations has been replaced with a single fast one</li>
<li>FIX: The chunk-uploading algorithm for Copy.Com could unnecessarily upload the same chunks multiple times. We have not had any reports, but we believe it's also theoretically possible that a Copy.Com upload could have been corrupted by the same issue, so recommend updating for all Copy.Com users.</li>
<li>FIX: Fix issue with site cloning whereby on sites with very large numbers of entries in the postmeta table that needed search/replacing, some could be omitted (in the case seen, the table had &#62;600,000 entries)</li>
<li>FIX: Saving the settings immediately after authenticating with Copy.Com resulted in being redirected to WP's page for all settings.</li>
<li>FIX: If PHP was killed by the webserver during the process of pruning old backups, then this would not be retried until the next backup, thus potentially leaving more backups than desired around in remote storage in the meanwhile.</li>
<li>FIX: Log files sometimes failed to mention the MySQL version</li>
<li>TRANSLATIONS: Various updated translations - thanks to our translators</li>
<li>TWEAK: When choosing multiple remote storage options (Premium), these are now stacked via tabs, instead of vertically as before</li>
<li>TWEAK: More help for enormous sites on badly resourced web hosting: part of the enumeration of uploads needing backing up is now cached, allowing more to be time when time limits are short</li>
<li>TWEAK: Secret credentials (e.g. S3 secret key) in the admin area are now starred (as explained in our long-standing FAQ, this does nothing to protect against malicious WordPress co-admins on your site - <a href="https://updraftplus.com/faqs/in-the-administration-section-it-shows-my-amazon-ftp-etc-passwords-without-using-stars-is-this-safe/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/faqs/in-the-administration-section-it-shows-my-amazon-ftp-etc-passwords-without-using-stars-is-this-safe/</a> - but at least we won't get asked about it so many times!).</li>
<li>TWEAK: Provide more direct help to the user if they are hosting with Strato and get the 'File Size Limit Exceeded' zip message</li>
<li>TWEAK: When migrating data directly to a remote site, if the remote site returns a 413 HTTP code ("Request Entity Too Large"), re-try using a smaller chunk size</li>
<li>TWEAK: Log when about to begin encryption of a database file (allowing the progress to be monitored more easily if there's a problem)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Detect a further case of an incompatible database (that is from a remote source and uses MySQL features not present on the destination server) and warn before attempting to import.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Make the error message shown if trying to restore an incompatible database (that is from a remote source and uses MySQL features not present on the destination server) clearer.</li>
<li>TWEAK: If the user uses "Backup Now" before saving their settings, warn them that the unsaved settings changes won't apply to this backup</li>
<li>TWEAK: Only warn about very large files found once for each file (rather than once per resumption)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add the UPDRAFTPLUS_GOOGLEDRIVE_DISABLEGZIP constant - define it as true to work-around broken HTTP setups (possibly broken outgoing proxy?) when accessing Google Drive</li>
<li>TWEAK: When claiming an add-on (paid versions), the user's updraftplus.com password will automatically be forgotten once it is no longer needed</li>
<li>TWEAK: Handle the case of the user typing in an invalid number of backups to retain more elegantly</li>
<li>TWEAK: No longer require the php-mcrypt module for Dropbox </li>
<li>TWEAK: Also retry a smaller chunk size if it looks like mod_security unhelpfully replaced a 413 HTTP code with a 200 success message despite the operation actually failing for this reason, or if it looks like sending is just timing out before the PHP timeout (so that we don't get notified).</li>
<li>TWEAK: Added new CA root certificates to store (<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem" rel="nofollow">http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem</a>)</li>
<li>TWEAK: If the Migrator's direct-send component drops its chunk size, then store this information so that it doesn't have to go through the cycle of finding the best chunk size the next time.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Added UPDRAFTPLUS_IPV4_ONLY constant to prevent use of IPv6 (currently implemented by Google Drive only)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Deal with a case where the web host appears to be losing disk I/O near kill time, despite later database writes going through (so, the order of operations was insufficient to guarantee what had been completed). This issue was only cosmetic - backup sets were intact (hence "tweak", not "fix")</li>
<li>TWEAK: Increase HTTP timeout for remote site-to-site operations</li>
<li>TWEAK: Don't cause the 'debug' tab to abort rendering if the web host has disabled the gzopen() function (which is an odd/pointless thing to do)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Resolve PHP 'strict standards' coding internal notice in Google Drive module</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.10.3 - 2015-06-09</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: Migration component can now send backup data directly from one WP site to another - <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftplus-premium/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/shop/updraftplus-premium/</a></li>
<li>FEATURE: Support active mode FTP servers (extremely rare)</li>
<li>FIX: The error message when choosing no components to restore was empty</li>
<li>FIX: Restore ability to run on WordPress 3.5 (actually fixed in downloads of 1.10.1 after 2015-05-13)</li>
<li>FIX: Some automatic pre-upgrade backups were not marked internally as such, leading UD to delete the oldest scheduled backup prematurely backups prematurely</li>
<li>TWEAK: Reduce HTTP round-trips when checking presence + downloading backup archives in a restore/migrate operation</li>
<li>TWEAK: Alert the user earlier if they're trying to use a database with a character set not supported by MySQL</li>
<li>TWEAK: Use separate internal jobs for separate downloads, and thus avoid race conditions when updating job data (symptom: download widgets that don't show current information)</li>

<li>TWEAK: Fix untranslated message when confirming the wiping of settings</li>
<li>TWEAK: Replace more non-SSL links to updraftplus.com with SSL links</li>
<li>TWEAK: Use a POST instead of a GET during one of the restore sub-stages (avoids a false positive on some mod_security setups)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Improve backup-file-naming routine to reduce the times when no ASCII name can be found (ASCII is preferred as not all cloud storage methods will accept arbitrary characters in filenames)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Don't keep a log file (unless debug mode is on) for scheduled tasks that result in the result that nothing needs backing up</li>
<li>TWEAK: Remove cache files from Cherry Framework child themes upon migration (framework misbehaves if cache files are present after URL change)</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.10.1 - 2015-05-12</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: Microsoft OneDrive support (Premium version) - full support (including chunked/resumable uploading and downloading)</li>
<li>FEATURE: Allow prevention of backup of unwanted tables, via a filter; see: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/faqs/how-can-i-exclude-a-specific-table-from-the-backup/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/faqs/how-can-i-exclude-a-specific-table-from-the-backup/</a></li>
<li>FIX: Restore window would not open if date contained a single quote character in it (which was possible only in some languages)</li>
<li>FIX: Restore the ability of PHP installations (&#60; 1%) without curl to use Google Drive (broke when Google introduced a new SSL certificate at their end which PHP couldn't handle properly without extra help).</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add woocommerce_order_items and relevanssi_log to the list of potentially huge tables that won't need search/replacing</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add link to admin email setting and fix broken link to reporting add-on in free version</li>
<li>TWEAK: Provide more direct help for paid users getting blocked by the security shield when connecting for updates access</li>
<li>TWEAK: Small tweak in zip-splitting algorithm if it looks likely that there are insufficient resources with no further resumptions yet scheduled</li>
<li>TWEAK: "Migrate" dialogue, when the Migrator is installed, now contains a widget to use directly (instead of just directing to other route)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Ask user to confirm if they navigate away from the settings page with unsaved changes</li>
<li>TWEAK: Replace some non-SSL links to updraftplus.com with SSL links, and replace all non-SSL readme links</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add UPDRAFTPLUS_DBSCAN_TIMEOUT constant to control how much time is allowed for scanning database, and make the default vary instead of constant (will help users with absolutely enormous databases).</li>
<li>TWEAK: Provide clearer guidance to users with a wrong updraftplus.com password entered for updates</li>
<li>TWEAK: When cloning a site with Jetpack, automatically clear Jetpack invalid connection status</li>
<li>TWEAK: Prevent some old admin notices from being repeated when saving settings</li>

<h4>1.9.64 - 2015-04-20</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: (Premium) Added wizard to make it easier to create limited-access AWS users (requires PHP 5.3.3)</li>
<li>SECURITY: Fix non-persistent back-end XSS vulnerability, reported by Sucuri - <a href="https://updraftplus.com/new-security-vulnerability-found-across-significant-numbers-of-wordpress-plugins-including-updraftplus/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/new-security-vulnerability-found-across-significant-numbers-of-wordpress-plugins-including-updraftplus/</a></li>
<li>FIX: Fix failure to access some files (e.g. for downloading or deleting) in Google Drive folders that contained &#62;100 UpdraftPlus backup archives (thanks to IanUK for his help)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Amazon S3 reduced redundancy storage (a feature of UpdraftPlus Premium) now requires use of PHP 5.3.3 or later.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Various fixes to bring automatic backups code up to date with WP 4.2 release candidate 1 (there were some changes since beta 3, which worked since UD 1.9.62)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Update to version 2.0 of plugin updater class (<a href="https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker</a>) - necessary on WP 4.2 to prevent shiny updates after the first failing when 3rd party plugins exist, and to suppress a PHP notice on the plugins page.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add wp_rp_tags to the list of potentially huge tables that won't need search/replacing</li>
<li>TRANSLATION: New Slovenian translation, courtesy of Clav Icula</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.63 - 2015-04-03</h4>

<ul>
<li>TWEAK: Revert to previous global SSL CA bundle: it seems Amazon S3 still has servers with 1024-bit SSL certificates</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.62 - 2015-04-01</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: Automatic backups now integrate with the forthcoming WP 4.2's "shiny plugin updates"</li>
<li>COMPATIBILITY: Tested and marked compatible with the forthcoming WordPress 4.2 (tested up to beta 3)</li>
<li>FIX: Fix regression in 1.9.60 for corner-case of S3 users with no permission to check their bucket's location (but permission to write to it).</li>
<li>TWEAK: Make "settings saved" message disappear after a few seconds, to prevent UI clutter</li>
<li>TWEAK: Decrease UI clutter in backup time selection</li>
<li>TWEAK: Update to latest global SSL CA bundle, removing again 1024-bit root CAs (last attempted in 1.9.26, but S3 still had some legacy servers). Modern web browsers have not accepted these for 6 months now. (SSL verification can be turned off in the expert options).</li>
<li>TWEAK: Defeat WP Download Manager Google Drive plugin's loading of its SDK on all pages (conflicting with UD when UD attempts to backup to Google Drive)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Detect case of old MySQL on Windows with table prefix that varies by case (and hence WP actually only works by accident) - produce a consistent backup that can be restored on any MySQL server.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add dashboard notice with links to more resources, for free users who've been installed &#62;4 weeks (with option to dismiss notice)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add itsec_log to the list of tables of non-essential/not-needing-search/replace + likely to be large tables for backup strategy</li>
<li>TWEAK: Improvement to scheduling algorithm in case where WP's scheduler starts same resumption multiple times - prevent next attempt being delayed longer than necessary</li>

<li>TWEAK: Tweak debug output of webserver information to avoid triggering a (silly) mod_security rule in some setups</li>
<li>TWEAK: Alert the user if using Amazon S3 if they do not have the PHP XML Writer module available</li>
<li>TWEAK: Log the fact that local deletions are being skipped, if the user set that option.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Give timestamp of WPB2D backups without relying upon location of SQL file</li>
<li>TWEAK: Detect a situation on migration where the uploads path is changed (from a site that began pre-WP 3.5) that was previously undetected</li>
<li>TRANSLATIONS: French translation updated from less than half to complete, thanks to Erwan Fran&#231;ois. Various other translations updated (many thanks to all translators).</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.60 - 2015-02-24</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: When using "Backup Now", and keeping the UpdraftPlus settings page open, a broken WP scheduler will not prevent the backup's progress.</li>
<li>FEATURE: Amazon's "EU Central 1" Frankfurt region now supported again (Amazon began requiring their new signature method at this location - probably a sign of things to come everywhere). PHP 5.3.3 required for this region.</li>
<li>FEATURE: Database backup files can now be handled when uncompressed - i.e., you can remove the gzip compression, and use the resulting file (useful for large backups on slow/limited hosting: pre-decompressing the file will reduce the processing time needed)</li>
<li>FEATURE: Introduced new in-page auto-backup widget that can resume, and thus cope with a backup of any size. This feature is in preparation of WP 4.2's major re-write of the updating user experience flow.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Update PHP-Opencloud (Rackspace) and dependency libraries to current versions.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Make sure that activity is recorded periodically when adding database tables to the final database backup (found a site with over 7,500 tables)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Don't bother to attempt to detect double-gz compression on setups where it can't be handled (where gzseek() has been disabled in the PHP configuration)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Added free/Premium comparison table to the free version</li>
<li>TWEAK: Importer (part of UpdraftPlus Premium) can now import generic .sql, .sql.gz and .sql.bz2 files</li>
<li>TWEAK: Don't show the "memory limit" warning in a case where the value could not be accurately detected</li>
<li>TWEAK: If the user chooses the "email" remote storage method, then a warning will be added if the archive being sent is bigger than most mailservers can carry (and will be removed if it is successfully sent), thus giving the user a hint as to the failure cause (if they overlooked the existing warning in the email settings).</li>
<li>TWEAK: The importer (part of UpdraftPlus Premium) can now import the latest BackupWordPress format databases</li>
<li>TWEAK: Flush output buffer explicitly when closing the browser connection - prevents delayed feedback on some setups</li>
<li>TWEAK: Automatic backups are now offered if you go to the 'Plugins' page, and update via the 'More information' iframe</li>
<li>TWEAK: Trim spaces from Google Drive client_id/secret - some users didn't spot that they introduced whitespace when copy-pasting</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add "Simple Visitor Stats" and "Simple Feed Stats" tables to the list of tables that may have large amounts of data, and which don't need search/replacing when migrating</li>
<li>TWEAK: When restoring plugins and themes, log the list of entities being restored (helps with tracing problems)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Deal with CloudFTP/StorageMadeEasy returning directory listings in a non-standard format, when rescanning remote backups</li>
<li>TWEAK: Version numbering scheme for paid versions changed; see: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/change-in-updraftpluss-version-numbering-scheme-for-paid-versions/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/change-in-updraftpluss-version-numbering-scheme-for-paid-versions/</a></li>
<li>TRANSLATIONS: Updated translations in several languages (many thanks for our translators)</li>
<li>FIX: For imported 3rd-party backups, the 'Existing Backups' tab (only) was showing "Unknown Source" instead of the detected source.</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.52 - 2015-02-07</h4>

<ul>
<li>FIX: Fix issue when migrating (hence, in Premium versions only) backups with very large options tables output by mysqldump, which could cause the site URL to finish with an incorrect value</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.51 - 2015-02-03</h4>

<ul>
<li>SECURITY: Prevent nonce leak that could allow logged-in users who aren't admins (if you have any) to access backups, UpdraftPlus settings and perform other harmful actions. No issue exists for users of UpdraftPlus Premium, or if you have the stand-alone "Automatic Backups" or "No Adverts" add-ons, or if your site has no untrusted users who can log in (or whilst have dismissed the "Automatic Backups" notice on the updates page). Credit to Sucuri (<a href="http://sucuri.net" rel="nofollow">http://sucuri.net</a>) for identifying this issue, and notifying us of it.</li>
</ul>

<li>TWEAK: Prevent a "not tested on this version of WP" message showing for a short time after install of a new version, when it only applied to the previous version</li>
<li>TWEAK: Reduce HTTP timeout when checking for available plugin updates (paid versions) from 10 to 5 seconds</li>
<li>TWEAK: Tidy up the post-restore screen a little - one less info box.</li>
<li>TWEAK: When a restore finishes, WP Super Cache's cache will be emptied (if present), to prevent confusion caused by cached pre-restore pages.</li>
<li>TWEAK: Slight change to how the 'mothership' for updates is calculated, for more flexibility in our in-house testing</li>
<li>TWEAK: Log more informative error if user chooses 'FTP' for their remote storage, but adds no FTP settings</li>
<li>TWEAK: Change "any other directory" to "any other file/directory" in the "more files" add-on, to better reflect its capabilities</li>
<li>TWEAK: Make sure that "more files" will skip UD's temporary directory, if asked to back up a parent directory of it</li>
<li>TWEAK: Default to https for updates checking, with fallback to http (only relevant to versions from updraftplus.com)</li>
<li>TWEAK: Prevent 'Strict Standards' PHP coding notice with WebDAV on PHP 5.5</li>
<li>TWEAK: Provide clickable link through to the admin email address in the reporting settings</li>
<li>TWEAK: If the gzopen or gzread functions are disabled in the PHP install, then the message saying so omitted to say which one (or both)</li>
<li>FIX: WebDAV upload method could very occasionally fail to detect upload error conditions</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.46 - 2014-12-29</h4>

<ul>
<li>FEATURE: Chunked/resumable uploads are now supported for SFTP</li>
<li>FIX: Scan for existing backup sets added manually to local storage in recent versions could overlook some unless clicked twice, in non-GMT timezones</li>
<li>TWEAK: Work-around issue in Manage WP worker plugin which caused a crash when authenticating with Dropbox</li>
<li>TWEAK: Prevent PHP notice when listing files on SFTP server</li>
<li>TWEAK: Reset an internal upload counter used to detect activity when a cloud storage switch is made due to no apparent activity - could prevent some large, long-running uploads on hosts with little available execution time</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.45 - 2014-12-20</h4>

<ul>
<li>FIX: Fix case in which the database imported from a BackWPUp backup could be falsely identified as missing (introduced in 1.9.40)</li>
<li>FIX: WordPress installs with ALTERNATE_WP_CRON set could skip some scheduled backups (since 1.9.19, so it appears that the conditions required to cause this bug are rare)</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.9.44 - 2014-12-13</h4>

<ul>
<li>TRANSLATIONS: Add new incomplete translations (ready for the wordpress.org change to take translation availability into account when searching for plugins): Norwegian Bokm&#229;l, Norwegian Nynorsk, Finnish, Hebrew, Catalan, Vietnamese, Bengali</li>
<li>FIX: Fix a failure to detect the progress properly for large backup sets, introduced in 1.9.40</li>
</ul>

15th 2014)</li>
<li>TWEAK: When an invalid JSON response is received during restore stage 2,
display the data directly (not just in the error console, where not everyone
will think of looking).</li>
<li>TWEAK: 3rd party backups which are missing expected entities are now handled
more gracefully</li>
<li>TWEAK: The fancy report now tells the user what paths are in the zips for
any additional paths they configured to add to the backup</li>
<li>TWEAK: Add a swifter resumption in one corner case (efficiency)</li>
<li>TWEAK: If a zip error is encountered on cPanel, then the free disk space is
checked, to potentially give the user more information on probable causes</li>
<li>TWEAK: You can now remove your updraftplus.com password from the settings
(paid version) without losing your access to updates</li>
<li>TWEAK: Suppress top advert if the user is on their first go (free version -

<h4>1.9.26 - 2014/09/22</h4>

<ul>
<li>TWEAK: There are still some Amazon S3 servers validated via a Verisign
1024-bit certificate, causing backup to fail due to SSL validation failure.

<h4>Can UpdraftPlus do (something)?</h4>

<p>Check out <a href="https://updraftplus.com/updraftplus-full-feature-list/">our full list of features</a>, and our <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">add-ons shop</a> and <a href="https://updraftplus.com/comparison-updraftplus-free-updraftplus-premium/">free/Premium comparison table</a>.</p>

<h4>I found a bug. What do I do?</h4>

<p>Note - this FAQ is for users of the free plugin. If you're a paying customer, then you should go here: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/support/" rel="nofollow">https://updraftplus.com/support/</a> - please don't ask question in the WordPress.Org forum about purchases, as that's against their rules.</p>

<p>Next, please make sure you read this FAQ through - it may already have the answer you need. If it does, then please consider a donation (e.g. buy our "No Adverts" add-on - <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">https://updraftplus.com/shop/</a>); it takes time to develop this plugin and FAQ.</p>

<p>If it does not, then contact us (<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/updraftplus">the forum is the best way</a>)! This is a complex backup plugin and the only way we can ensure it's robust is to get bug reports and fix the problems that crop up. Please make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin, and that you include the version in your bug report - if you are not using the latest, then the first thing you will be asked to do is upgrade.</p>

<p>Please include the backup log if you can find it (there are links to download logs on the UpdraftPlus settings page; or you may be emailed it; failing that, it is in the directory wp-content/updraft, so FTP in and look for it there). If you cannot find the log, then I may not be able to help so much, but you can try - include as much information as you can when reporting (PHP version, your blog's site, the error you saw and how you got to the page that caused it, any other relevant plugins you have installed, etcetera). <a href="http://pastebin.com" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com</a> is a good place to post the log.</p>

<p>If you know where to find your PHP error logs (often a file called error_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory (check via FTP)), then that's even better (don't send multi-megabytes; just send the few lines that appear when you run a backup, if any).</p>

<p>If you are a programmer and can debug and send a patch, then that's even better.</p>

<h4>Anything essential to know?</h4>

<p>After you have set up UpdraftPlus, you must check that your WordPress backups are taking place successfully. WordPress is a complex piece of software that runs in many situations. Don't wait until you need your backups before you find out that they never worked in the first place. Remember, there's no warranty and no guarantees - this is free software.</p>

<h4>My enormous website is hosted by a dirt-cheap provider who starve my account of resources, and UpdraftPlus runs out of time! Help! Please make UpdraftPlus deal with this situation so that I can save two dollars!</h4>

<p>UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right from the beginning, so that it does not need to do everything in a single go; but this has limits. If your website is huge and your web hosting company gives your tiny resources on an over-loaded server, then go into the "Expert settings" and reduce the size at which zip files are split (versions 1.6.53 onwards). UpdraftPlus is known to successfully back up websites that run into the multiple-gigabytes on web servers that are not resource-starved.</p>

<h4>My site was hacked, and I have no backups! I thought UpdraftPlus was working! Can I kill you?</h4>

<p>No, there's no warranty or guarantee, etc. It's completely up to you to verify that UpdraftPlus is creating your backups correctly. If it doesn't then that's unfortunate, but this is a free plugin.</p>

<h4>I am not running the most recent version of UpdraftPlus. Should I upgrade?</h4>

<p>Yes; especially before you submit any support requests.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.3 make it even easier to format your content and customize your site.</p>
<p><iframe width='692' height='389' src='https://videopress.com/embed/T54Iy7Tw?hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1435166243'></script></p>
<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.3:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 2 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Site icons for all</em><br />
<em>Live preview menu changes</em><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.2 is now available. This is a <strong>critical security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>Version 4.2.2 addresses two security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Genericons icon font package, which is used in a number of popular themes and plugins, contained an HTML file vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. All affected themes and plugins hosted on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> (including the Twenty Fifteen default theme) have been updated today by the WordPress security team to address this issue by removing this nonessential file. To help protect other Genericons usage, WordPress 4.2.2 proactively scans the wp-content directory for this HTML file and removes it. Reported by Robert Abela of <a href="http://netsparker.com">Netsparker</a>.</li>
<li>WordPress versions 4.2 and earlier are affected by a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/">critical cross-site scripting vulnerability</a>, which could enable anonymous users to compromise a site. WordPress 4.2.2 includes a comprehensive fix for this issue. Reported separately by Rice Adu and Tong Shi from Baidu[X-team].</li>
</ul>
<p>The release also includes hardening for a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability when using the visual editor. This issue was reported by Mahadev Subedi.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.2 also contains fixes for 13 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.2">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=32418&amp;stop_rev=32324">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.2</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.2.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.2:</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.3 make it even easier to format your content and customize your site.</p>
<p><iframe width='692' height='389' src='https://videopress.com/embed/T54Iy7Tw?hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1435166243'></script></p>
<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>The Team</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.3:</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Site icons for all</em><br />
<em>Live preview menu changes</em><br />
<em>Four three beta now</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.2 is now available. This is a <strong>critical security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>Version 4.2.2 addresses two security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Genericons icon font package, which is used in a number of popular themes and plugins, contained an HTML file vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. All affected themes and plugins hosted on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> (including the Twenty Fifteen default theme) have been updated today by the WordPress security team to address this issue by removing this nonessential file. To help protect other Genericons usage, WordPress 4.2.2 proactively scans the wp-content directory for this HTML file and removes it. Reported by Robert Abela of <a href="http://netsparker.com">Netsparker</a>.</li>
<li>WordPress versions 4.2 and earlier are affected by a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/">critical cross-site scripting vulnerability</a>, which could enable anonymous users to compromise a site. WordPress 4.2.2 includes a comprehensive fix for this issue. Reported separately by Rice Adu and Tong Shi from Baidu[X-team].</li>
</ul>
<p>The release also includes hardening for a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability when using the visual editor. This issue was reported by Mahadev Subedi.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.2 also contains fixes for 13 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.2">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=32418&amp;stop_rev=32324">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.2</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.2.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.2:</p>

	<title>WPTavern: The WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48012</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who regularly comment on the Tavern may have noticed that your comments don&amp;#8217;t show up immediately after submitting them. That&amp;#8217;s because about four weeks ago, for the first time in the Tavern&amp;#8217;s history, comment moderation for all comments was enabled. I enabled moderation to address concerns raised by members of the community and to sleep better at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the request of a few readers and to be more transparent, I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/comment-policy&quot;&gt;comment moderation policy&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of at least a dozen people, I&amp;#8217;ve crafted a policy that is easy to read and more importantly, easy to follow. It explains our expectations, has a few tips on writing better comments, and lists possible reasons a comment may be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;&gt;CC0 licensed&lt;/a&gt; which is the least restrictive license offered by Creative Commons. Feel free to copy and modify it for your own use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strive to create a fun, friendly, and inviting atmosphere. The ground rules for commenting on WP Tavern are simple. Treat people the way you want to be treated. Try to understand someone else’s perspective and if you disagree, respectfully explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text is a difficult medium to decipher context. Emoticons and emoji help, but it doesn’t solve the problem. Take a deep breath and assume the commenter has the best of intentions before responding and approach discussions with open minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome different perspectives and viewpoints but we all need to clearly communicate them without tearing the opposition down in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay on point using concise language. If your comment is more than a few paragraphs long, consider publishing it on your own site instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your comment may be deleted if it matches any of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocates an illegal practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses vulgar, profane, or unnecessarily harsh language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is spam or appears to be written primarily to post a link or advertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is written anonymously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains copyrighted material not licensed for distribution on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impersonates another user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains an affiliate link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal insults, including those using racist or sexist terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines are not meant to be an exhaustive list. The deletion of comments is wholly within the discretion of the moderators at WP Tavern and we will err on the side of maintaining a safe and friendly community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;How Do I Report Comments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe a comment published on WP Tavern violates any of the listed guidelines or that you feel needs special attention, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/contact-me&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;. Please do not publicly report comments using social media such as Facebook or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form submissions are sent to authors with comment moderation capabilities. Include a link to the comment in your email with a short explanation as to why it needs our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to reestablish the comment section as a place where people feel welcome to voice their opinions without the fear of being ripped apart. We encourage criticism, disagreements, and open conversation but it needs to take place in a respectful manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: A Day of REST — a conference devoted to the WordPress REST API</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14173</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/a-day-of-rest-a-conference-devoted-to-the-wordpress-rest-api/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;A Day of REST&lt;/a&gt; will be the first ever event dedicated to the WordPress REST API. It&amp;#8217;ll happen on January 28th 2016, with a follow-on hack day on the 29th, and will be held at Bishopsgate Institute in London, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is aimed at developers who want to learn how to interact with the new WordPress REST API. From WordPress developers to Javascript developers, to application developers, A Day of REST promises to provide in-depth information that covers every aspect of the WordPress REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of event I&amp;#8217;ve been hoping to see in the WordPress community. Sessions will vary from an introduction to the WordPress REST API to in-depth case studies and guides on utilizing it in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an incredible and rare opportunity to learn from the people making the API and those extending it further than anyone else. A niche event to be sure, A Day of REST  is a big bet on the WordPress REST API &amp;#8212; which is not yet slated for core, but is widely expected to make it to core in the next few releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference is being organized to supply a clear demand for more information, resources, and education on the subject. At most WordCamps, REST API sessions seem to be some of the most crowded, with the most engaged and curious audiences. A Day of REST will be like those sessions, but much bigger, as the entire day will be dedicated to the single topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is speaking at A Day of REST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14179&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/speakers-day-of-rest-752x603.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;speakers-day-of-rest&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker roster consists of people who are building the WordPress REST API, and those who are already using it for production applications and websites. The speakers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan McCue &amp;#8211;  WordPress REST API co-lead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Hoyle &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Bachhuber &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen Vignos &amp;#8211; Director of Engineering, WIRED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K. Adam White &amp;#8211; Open Web Engineer, Bocoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Lenox &amp;#8211; Design Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Taylor &amp;#8211; Senior Engineer, New York Times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski &amp;#8211; Meta Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post Status will be an official partner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really pleased that Post Status will be the official content partner for A Day of REST. That means I’ll be attending the event, and I&amp;#8217;ll offer a number of in-depth posts related to the WordPress REST API, the sessions, interviews, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll also manage content for some of the larger event announcements, like this one. I&amp;#8217;ve known the organizers for a long time, and they are big supporters of Post Status. A Day of REST offers a really great opportunity for me to work with them and offer my readers some unique privileges and exclusive content for a subject that&amp;#8217;s of interest to most of my audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So who is organizing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14180&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/humans-752x333.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;humans&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/organizations/human-made/&quot;&gt;Human Made&lt;/a&gt;, who’ve brought on board &lt;a href=&quot;http://siobhanmckeown.com/about/&quot;&gt;Siobhan McKeown&lt;/a&gt; to lead the charge putting the event together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Made uses the API in a good bit of their services and product work, are really interested to see more adoption of the API, and are eager to provide education resources so that can happen. Those of you who pay close attention may know that two of Human Made&amp;#8217;s own are actually part of the team of four that does much of the REST API development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rmccue&quot;&gt;Ryan McCue&lt;/a&gt; is the project co-lead, and is generally steering the ship; the API started as his GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle&quot;&gt;Joe Hoyle&lt;/a&gt; is in day to day conversations for project direction and also commits a lot of code to the API; he is a co-founder of Human Made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hack Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 29th January 2016, there will be a WordPress REST API hack day. This event is being hosted by Mozilla Spaces in London. Space for the hack day is limited but the team would love for anyone interested to come along and help make the WordPress REST API. Bring a laptop and expect to get hacking. This event will be for building the REST API specifically, and not geared toward other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ticket details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/tickets/&quot;&gt;from the website&lt;/a&gt;. They’re £125 (+ VAT &amp;amp; booking fees) &amp;#8212; which ends up being around $235 US &amp;#8212; and the price includes all of the usual conference goodies: presentations, lunch, swag, and an informal afterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confirmed sponsors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is excited to already have some awesome sponsors on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prospress.com/&quot;&gt;ProsPress&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sucuri.net/&quot;&gt;Sucuri&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is also looking for more sponsors to get involved and help make this unique event happen. If you’d like to sponsor, send an email to events@humanmade.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the content, you can get updates either from this blog, or from the A Day of REST website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;feelingrestful.com&lt;/a&gt;. You should also follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/feelingrestful&quot;&gt;@feelingrestful&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for live updates. I&amp;#8217;ll have in-depth content and broader event information and the event site will have more general announcements, news, and event updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is quite accessible from much of the world, so I am hopeful and confident that there will be a diverse audience in attendance. I certainly look forward to visiting; and I was pleasantly surprised that it doesn&amp;#8217;t get as cold there as I thought; January temperatures (lows and highs) stay around the 40s (F, or 5-9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_default&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_unit_c&quot;&gt;°&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; C) &amp;#8212; which is likely warmer than it&amp;#8217;ll be where I live in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is an exciting development in the WordPress conference ecosystem and I&amp;#8217;m confident it&amp;#8217;s going to be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Envato Implements Item Support Policy for ThemeForest and CodeCanyon</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47990</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/envato-implements-item-support-policy-for-themeforest-and-codecanyon</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In August of 2014, Envato &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/news/item-support-sustainability-authors-clarity-buyers/&quot;&gt;announced a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; that would allow sellers on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codecanyon.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;CodeCanyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;ThemeForest&lt;/a&gt; to inform buyers whether or not an item is supported. Earlier today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/releases/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/&quot;&gt;Envato implemented&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;Item Support Policy&lt;/a&gt; for sellers on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When browsing items on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, a blue badge indicates the seller provides support. There&amp;#8217;s also a badge and text that informs potential buyers if an item is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47991&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png?resize=639%2C408&quot; alt=&quot;This Item is Supported&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This Item is Supported
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt;, buyers automatically receive six months of support from the date of purchase. If you need support for an entire year, you can buy an extension for a nominal upgrade fee. Envato takes 30% and gives 70% of the purchase to authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of a &lt;b&gt;6-month support extension&lt;/b&gt; for a &lt;b&gt;Regular License&lt;/b&gt; is calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37.5% of the item price (30% of the list price) when purchased at the same time as the license;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;62.5% of the item price (50% of the list price) when purchased during the support period; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87.5% of the item price (70% of the list price) when purchased after the support period has ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Freeman, product manager for Envato, says the changes provide a standardized definition of support, &amp;#8220;Buyers will know exactly what to expect from all purchases on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers who purchased supported items before the new policy went into effect have six months of free tech support starting on September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disgruntled Authors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.envato.com/t/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/3619&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; with over 165 responses, sellers discussed the pros and cons of the policy while some expressed anger. &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/user/jonathan01&quot;&gt;Jonathan Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr3ativ.com/&quot;&gt;Cr3ativ&lt;/a&gt;, who sells several items on ThemeForest, thinks the policy is not as good as alternatives offered outside of the marketplaces because of its confusing complexity for both authors and buyers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure why Envato chose this solution when we already have a well established support/upgrade system in place within most of the WordPress community where 12 months of support is included in the purchase and customers receive a 50% discount to continue receiving support and updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is a work in progress, &amp;#8220;We will be monitoring the impacts of this change very closely and will be tweaking, improving and enhancing the support tools over coming weeks and months,&amp;#8221; Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a buyer or seller on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, let us know what you think of the support policy in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Twenty Sixteen Now Available on GitHub and the WordPress Theme Directory</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47973</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/twenty-sixteen-now-available-on-github-and-the-wordpress-theme-directory</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen, the default theme scheduled to ship with WordPress 4.4, is available for download on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/&quot;&gt;WordPress theme directory&lt;/a&gt;. According &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/29/twenty-sixteen-is-now-on-github/&quot;&gt;to Tammie Lister&lt;/a&gt;, Twenty Sixteen will be developed as if it were a feature plugin and will merge into WordPress core later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development takes place on GitHub, changes will regularly sync up to the WordPress theme directory. By installing and activating Twenty Sixteen from the theme directory, users can easily update to new versions as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Twenty Sixteen has 23 issues and 27 pull requests on GitHub. Many of the issues such as, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/pull/23&quot;&gt;introducing automated Travis CI build testing into Twenty Sixteen,&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/labels/discussion&quot;&gt;up for discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the top half of the Tavern looks like with Twenty Sixteen activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47974&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=1025%2C563&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the content section looks like. Notice the block of code that displays instead of an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47976&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=881%2C648&quot; alt=&quot;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen Activated
&lt;p&gt;Testers are encouraged to open issues and pull requests on GitHub. If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with how GitHub works, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; explains how to contribute to the Twenty Sixteen project. Keep in mind that Twenty Sixteen is a work in progress and should not be used in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Great jazz cover of one of my favorite Kendrick Lamar songs, Rigamortis, which of course is inspired by the great jazz song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=27&amp;v=TstRwZygLAo&quot;&gt;The Thorn by Willie Jones III&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress.com Unveils the Action Bar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47954</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-unveils-the-action-bar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/new-action-bar/&quot;&gt;unveiled a new user interface&lt;/a&gt; called the Action Bar. It&amp;#8217;s a bar that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen for logged in users and is accessible from any device. The bar performs multiple tasks depending on the page you&amp;#8217;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47955&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png?resize=1025%2C627&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Action Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress Action Bar
&lt;p&gt;When on a WordPress.com powered site that you&amp;#8217;re not following, the bar turns into a Follow button. Clicking the follow button will notify you of new posts published on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47956&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png?resize=192%2C60&quot; alt=&quot;Action Bar Follow Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Action Bar Follow Button
&lt;p&gt;If you click the three dots to the right, you&amp;#8217;ll see a variety of options depending upon the page you&amp;#8217;re viewing. If it&amp;#8217;s the homepage, you&amp;#8217;ll see links to download the theme the site uses, report the content, or manage the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re browsing a specific post on a WordPress.com site, you&amp;#8217;ll see an additional link to copy a shortlink for quick and easy sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47957&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png?resize=265%2C319&quot; alt=&quot;Easily Share Posts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easily Share Posts
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com and are logged in, the Follow button turns into a Customize button. This link provides a quick way to enter the Customizer. There&amp;#8217;s also an Edit link if you&amp;#8217;re browsing a published post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47958&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png?resize=307%2C348&quot; alt=&quot;Edit and Customize Links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Edit and Customize Links
&lt;p&gt;If the action bar is too big and you want to minimize it, click the three dots and select the option to Collapse the bar. It will shrink the bar into squares and get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the action bar is the ability to quickly see and download a theme used on a WordPress.com site. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for WordPress.com specific sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailypost.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The Daily Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What annoys me about the action bar is that it disappears when I scroll down. I caught myself scrolling down to read a post and when I looked for the edit button to fix a typo, the action bar was gone. I think it should stay on the screen at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to see the Edit link in the action bar open a front-end editor. It&amp;#8217;s time WordPress.com step up its game and stop forcing users through a backend interface to edit published content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the experimental action bar but at the same time, I question the reasoning for adding yet another user interface element to mimic actions already supported by other buttons and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, between the admin bar, dashboard, the edit link underneath a post, and the action bar, there are now four different ways to edit a post. How many roads are necessary to reach the same destination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com, let me know what you think of the action bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.3.3 Patches Security Vulnerabilities in BuddyPress Messages Component</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47948</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-3-patches-security-vulnerabilities-in-buddypress-messages-component</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-41978&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=828%2C265&quot; alt=&quot;BuddyPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3&lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2015/08/buddypress-2-3-3/&quot;&gt; is available&lt;/a&gt; and users are encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;update as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. A few security vulnerabilities were discovered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/buddypress-components-and-features/#internal-messaging&quot;&gt;BuddyPress Messages, &lt;/a&gt;a core component that allows users to send and receive private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to the BuddyPress team that could allow members to manipulate a failed private outbound message and inject unexpected output to the browser. The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof Katowicz-Kowalewski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the first vulnerability, the BuddyPress core development team independently discovered and fixed related vulnerabilities with the messages component that could allow for carefully crafted private message content to be rendered incorrectly to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3 also fixes a couple of bugs in the 2.3 codebase and improves support for backend changes made in WordPress 4.3. To protect your sites from these vulnerabilities, you should perform a full backup and &lt;strong&gt;update BuddyPress as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Theme Review Team Begins Phasing Out Favicon Support</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47940</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-begins-phasing-out-favicon-support</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main features in WordPress 4.3 are Site Icons. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icon&lt;/a&gt; is an image that represents a website across multiple platforms and replaces Favicons. With Site Icons in WordPress core, the WordPress Theme Review team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;phasing out the feature&lt;/a&gt; in existing themes hosted in the theme directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;p&gt;Justin Tadlock, a theme review admin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;published a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to provide a backwards compatible experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tadlock, the easiest method is to check if the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; function exists. This tells you if the user is running WordPress 4.3 and has the site icon feature available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check if the user has set up a new icon using the core WordPress feature by using the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; conditional tag which returns either &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some example code from the tutorial you can use to handle the check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ( ! function_exists( 'has_site_icon' ) || ! has_site_icon() ) {

    // Output old, custom favicon feature.
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional information, I encourage you to read&lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/wordpress/development/backwards-compatibility-site-icons/&quot;&gt; Stephen Cronin&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; which goes into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Theme Review Team enforces a guideline where features added to core are phased out of themes within two major releases. By the time WordPress 4.5 is released, theme authors will be able to remove legacy code without disrupting the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47930</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-summit-set-for-december-2-3-2015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/08/26/2015-wordpress-community-summit-dates-announced/&quot;&gt;WordPress community summit&lt;/a&gt; will take place on December 2-3, 2015, in Philadelphia, PA two days before WordCamp US. The summit&amp;nbsp;will be held at &lt;a href=&quot;http://philadelphia.impacthub.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Impact Hub Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, a co-working space where freelancers, entrepreneurs, and social innovators work together, share ideas, and build networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ImpactHub.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47931&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ImpactHub.jpg?resize=500%2C333&quot; alt=&quot;inside Impact Hub&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Inside Impact HubImpact Hub is spacious and has dedicated meeting and conference rooms. According to the announcement, the summit is invite only similar to last year’s event at WordCamp San Francisco:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WordPress Community Summit is a smaller, invite-only event for&amp;nbsp;active members and contributors on the many teams that work to improve&amp;nbsp;WordPress: Core, Design, Mobile, Accessibility, Support, Polygots, Documentation, Themes, Plugins, Community, Meta, Training, Flow&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;TV .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey or application form will soon be published which will result in a pool from which the attendees will be invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit is a rare opportunity for members of various contributor teams to focus and work together in the same physical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual WordPress Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use, build, or make a living with WordPress, please take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2015&quot;&gt;annual survey&lt;/a&gt;. Results will be shared during Matt Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation at WordCamp US. The more people who fill out the survey, the more representative the data will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation from 2014 to see results from the previous survey.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Stream Is Shutting Down Its Cloud Data Storage October 1st</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47925</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/stream-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-data-storage-october-1st</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/introducing-stream-3/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt; and includes some significant improvements. Stream is a WordPress plugin that tracks changes to a site similar to an audit trail. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service&quot;&gt;version two was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, it morphed from a plugin to a service. Activity logs were stored in the cloud which lessened the amount of resources used on local webservers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version three will no longer store data in the cloud. Instead, it will store activity logs locally. The cloud service provided by Stream 2 is closing on &lt;strong&gt;October 1st&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives users a little more than a month to migrate data from the cloud to their local webserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cloud is Expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Carbis, lead developer of Stream, says the time frame was chosen based on a number of factors, &amp;#8220;We chose a 6 week migration window as a balance between bleeding cash and doing the right thing by our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s also helpful to remember that the vast majority of our users are on a Free plan, which only includes 12 weeks of storage. We are monitoring the accounts of each of our paid users and I&amp;#8217;m personally making sure that every one of them has migrated,&amp;#8221; Carbis told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move away from the cloud is largely based on cost. The majority of Stream&amp;#8217;s customers signed up to the free plan with a significant lack of interest in the Pro Subscription. Server costs were also higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XWP to The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lack of income from Stream 2 and acquisition talks failing, Carbis was contracted to do outside work leaving Frankie Jarrett the only person working on the project. Stream&amp;#8217;s investor decided to pull the plug on the project at the same time Jarrett decided to resign from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I heard that Frankie had resigned I gave him a call. We reminisced on our achievements, and threw around some of our ideas on what could have been. That conversation renewed my inspiration. I jotted down some notes, and that’s when things started to turn around,&amp;#8221; Carbis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members from &lt;a href=&quot;https://xwp.co/&quot;&gt;XWP&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to lend a helping hand and the project is now officially under the XWP umbrella. This allows Stream to remain free and open source. The partnership will also facilitate add-on, connectors, and adapters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New in Stream 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is rewritten from the ground up. Activity logs use half the space in the database compared to Stream 2. It supports multisite through the use of Network Admin and uses a dependency injection model to be more extendable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Stream 3 includes a variety of improvements two notable features have been removed, Notifications and Reports. If you depend on these features, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/stream-3-faq/&quot;&gt;review the following FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbis and XWP are taking Stream into a new direction. Stream&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wp-stream/roadmap/&quot;&gt;proposed roadmap&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub and Carbis encourages users to not only review it, but to contribute to the project&amp;#8217;s future, &amp;#8220;I’d like to see Stream’s users contribute more to its direction. Contribution isn’t limited to ideas either. If you can design, develop, or translate, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wp-stream/stream&quot;&gt;contributing to the Stream project&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if Stream can regain the momentum it lost after transitioning to a cloud based system to store data. Now that Stream stores activity logs locally again, those in the EU should be able to use it without breaking privacy laws. Stream is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; on the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Akismet: Quantifying Reddit Bigotry</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1859</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/08/27/quantifying-reddit-bigotry/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2015-08-30): It looks like the team who created the tool decided to retire it due to some reported accuracy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never pass on the opportunity to mix in a little bit of humor with our passion for web content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our engineers, Dan Walmsley, participated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedyhackday.org/la-2015&quot;&gt;Cultivated Wit&amp;#8217;s Comedy Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles last weekend, and his team&amp;#8217;s resulting project has since surfaced on &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-tool-quantifies-reddit-bigotry&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/26/reddit-bigotry-check/&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeredditcheck.com/&quot;&gt;Free Reddit Check&lt;/a&gt;, created by Dan&amp;#8217;s team and crowned with the day&amp;#8217;s top prize, is a site which attempts to quantify the terribleness of Reddit users based on their public comment content and subreddit participation. While perfectly suited for a hack day which pairs developers and comedians, there is certainly usefulness in determining the respectability of a potential online acquaintance. Or just knowing who to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being obsessed with content analysis, community moderation, and keeping the web&amp;#8217;s underbelly in check, we can&amp;#8217;t help but think it&amp;#8217;s a nifty idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1859&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: First Look at the Twenty Sixteen Default WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47897</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.4 is the last scheduled major release of the year and with it will come a new default theme to replace Twenty Fifteen. On the Make WordPress Core site, Tammie Lister &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/25/introducing-twenty-sixteen/&quot;&gt;published an image gallery&lt;/a&gt; that shows off the design of Twenty Sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lister, the process of determining the new default theme has taken months, &amp;#8220;Lots of themes were considered, eventually settling on the one you see below. It’s a perfect fit,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47898&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png?resize=433%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen
&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen is designed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi&quot;&gt;Takashi Irie,&lt;/a&gt; who also designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2013/12/13/twenty-fourteen-wordpress-3-8-parker/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fourteen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2015/03/19/twenty-fifteen-the-wordpress-default-theme-for-2015/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; default themes. Irie describes Twenty Sixteen as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modernized approach of an ever-popular layout — a horizontal masthead and an optional right sidebar that works well with both blogs and websites. It has custom color options that allow you to make your own Twenty Sixteen. The theme was designed on a harmonious fluid grid with a mobile first approach. This means it looks great on any device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theme has hints of Twenty Fourteen but is different enough to stand on its own as a unique design. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look as modern as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; out-of-the box but the design could change during the 4.4 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help Twenty Sixteen be the best it can be, please join the weekly meetings held every Monday and Friday at 16:00 UTC in the #core-themes channel on &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt;. The meetings are a half hour-long and start once the theme is initially added to WordPress core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think of Twenty Sixteen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: OSTraining Makes Pods Framework Video Training Series Available for Free</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47885</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-40653&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg?resize=628%2C290&quot; alt=&quot;pods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/&quot;&gt;OSTraining&lt;/a&gt;, a site that offers video training for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and other technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/blog/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;http://pods.io/&quot;&gt;Pods Framework&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;training series&lt;/a&gt; is now available for free. Steve Burge, founder of OSTraining.com, says offering the video series for free is the result of a partnership with the Pods Framework project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This project came about because the OSTraining and Pods teams bumped into each other on a regular basis. I often ran into Jim True and Josh Pollock from Pods. We met at WordCamps and WordPress meetups in Tampa, Orlando, and Miami, FL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Pods team explained that they were working on improving their documentation. They started a YouTube series, wrote tutorials, and started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/pods-lead-developer-scott-kingsley-clark-launches-friends-of-pods-funding-campaign&quot;&gt;Friends of Pods&lt;/a&gt; initiative to support their efforts. Making the videos free is our way of contributing to the Pods project,&amp;#8221; Burge told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burge recorded the series after using Pods to create the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appalachiantrail.com/&quot;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt; website. The series provides an introduction to Pods, templates, creating a custom taxonomy, and more. Those interested can view the series on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;OSTraining.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk9dCVMQRmSptuJ6YdVzMkr5&amp;v=4rm95kNxRXg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a look at the first video in the series which introduces viewers to the Pods Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was created in 2014, the series contains great insight into the project and provides an educational foundation for learning Pods 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Request: Alex King Rememberances</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=22017</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear WordPress community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apologies for the selfish and personal nature of this post. I hope you will forgive me given the circumstances. As most of you know, I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as &amp;#8220;dad&amp;#8221;, but when she gets older she&amp;#8217;ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent more than a decade in the WordPress community and I&amp;#8217;d like to request that you to share a few thoughts or remembrances about me that we can compile and share with her when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have crossed paths or if I have managed to do something that you found helpful, I&amp;#8217;d love it if you would take a few minutes to write it down and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/contact&quot;&gt;send it to me&lt;/a&gt; or my wife: heatherkingcom@gmail.com. If you&amp;#8217;re willing to have the story shared publicly, please indicate that accordingly. By default, we will keep everything confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the thread: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; an ongoing story on this site. View the thread timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Step Up Your Game: How to Work With Successful WordPress Clients</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47868</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/step-up-your-game-how-to-work-with-successful-wordpress-clients</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47869&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Mario Y. Peshev&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Ryan Hellyer&quot; href=&quot;http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mario Peshev&lt;/a&gt;. Mario is the founder and WordPress Architect at &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/p9TnMSFMi2&quot;&gt;DevriX&lt;/a&gt; building and maintaining large WordPress-driven platforms. With over 10,000 hours of consulting and training, Mario&amp;#8217;s Yin and Yang is his Open Source advocacy and business growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning &amp;#8211; Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47879&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png?resize=682%2C281&quot; alt=&quot;Step up your game featured image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58522126@N00/430932479&quot;&gt;Stairwell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a learnaholic for as long as I can remember and when I read the aforementioned quote, it resonates strongly with me. My prelude to WordPress years ago was one of the steps toward improvement and success and I’ve developed a special love-hate relationship with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utmost admiration about its influence over the world in terms of Open Source and opportunities for various people in different niches, and its plague of being diminished and depreciated by professional developers and successful businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to solve these issues as long as the inner circle works towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are happy building lego type websites with random ThemeForest themes and you see that as your future, this post is not for you. If you love doing the same repeatedly for mom and pop shops, this may not resonate with you. This is applicable to people who want to get better at what they do, be more professional, and make some impact by solving complex problems for larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress For a Better Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, I presented at a conference focused on kids and teenagers to motivate them, prepare them for the adult life, and nurture their creativity. Kids these days hardly think about their future, between their teenage emotional dramas and boring homework assignments. If you think about it, how can they be passionate about becoming someone if they have no real idea what they need to know and do on a daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used WordPress as an example of a platform that children can use, one that provides them with the opportunity to develop a talent or passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using WordPress for homework and general notes (or a diary) could indicate interest in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young bloggers can potentially do creative writing or copywriting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly switching themes and playing with colors might open the room to design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding plugins and trying to implement complex combinations is the first step to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing posts, looking at analytics and comparing different titles or photos is the way to marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other potential areas of course, but as long as kids can associate with an activity, become passionate about it, and start digging into it, they can save years of slacking, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars on college degrees for specialties they couldn’t care less about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why more and more people join the WordPress industry and switch boring jobs in order to make a living off of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Types Of WordPress Services Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of opportunities for WordPress work is incredible but the vast pool of WordPress jobs is so vague and blurry, that hiring and educating talent is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep an eye on dozens of job boards, portals, and freelance networks. Clients look for Virtual Assistants to get their websites built. They look for expert WordPress developers to apply content changes to their site or web designers to develop complex plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis I see references to WordPress administrators, programmers, developers, designers, marketers, digital artists, webmasters, VAs, and plenty of other job titles used improperly. As a matter of fact, I’m now fascinated when I see a WordPress related job post or an offer looking for the right type of candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news is that you can do anything with WordPress. The caveat here is that WordPress itself is not a skill. You don’t ask for an Internet expert nowadays and you don’t go to the same doctor when you have a headache or you’ve injured your leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide industry of innocent clients and amateur service providers have made it nearly impossible to tell a developer from a marketer, or from a general user who has installed WordPress with an auto-installer twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Indecent World of WordPress Experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-39089&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Job Titles Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/5565517971&quot;&gt;I love &amp;#8217;84&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a lot about impostor syndrome in several reputable WordPress blogs, and people keep identifying themselves in the comments. In my opinion, this is a problem so insignificant as compared to the ever-growing pool of people claiming to be WordPress Experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last several years, I’ve interacted with people all around the world working with WordPress. From freelancers to successful business owners at conferences, and from beginner virtual assistants to full-stack consultants in social media, blogs and job networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of service providers that I’ve found is the one of &lt;em&gt;WordPress experts&lt;/em&gt;. You can easily substitute expert with specialist, guru, master, ninja and rockstar. Just open a new tab and do a few quick searches in Google, job networks, social media and view the large number of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list are &lt;em&gt;WordPress developers&lt;/em&gt;. A WordPress developer is often described as people who install plugins. There are various possible scenarios, but this is rarely the definition of an actual developer proficient in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some boards or blogs list specific skills that let you filter by programming language or a separate tool. My latest research with 200 contractors with WordPress developer titles led to 170 people who rate themselves with 4 or 5 out of 5 stars in PHP proficiency, and 30 with 3 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 170 people in the first group, 150 were college students, Internet marketers, VAs, and people who have substituted strings in WordPress themes thanks to support forums or help from the Codex. Not a single line of code was written from scratch, let alone building anything, and 4 out of 5 or higher self-assessed their level of PHP experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom McFarlin &lt;a href=&quot;http://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-developers-programmer-implementer/&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the difference between a developer and implementer and I wrote an overview defining &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-job-titles-dont-mean-much-anymore&quot;&gt;various technical skills in the WordPress context&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the lack of proper training, any official educational resource or meaningful set of skills per role, both finding talent and improving one’s skills is being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge you to interview several successful clients around you who looked for skillful WordPress folks. They either happened to know the right people, were recommended someone, ended up with several freelancers who messed up big time, went AWOL and suddenly took the cash and disappeared, couldn’t deliver, or they did and the site is incredibly slow and/or got hacked soon thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s sending serious businesses away and I won’t touch the topic of under pricing services and products which brings the quality and support way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivates people to use a reliable resource in order to grow? The WordPress Foundation, nor any of the big players provide official training curriculum, and a definition for formal roles. There is no WordPress certification program (I won’t get into that to avoid unnecessary discussions), and there are no clear paths for requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WordPress Community is Filled with Amateurs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, our community is a large group mostly composed of amateurs who started using WordPress one way or another. These people started earning money and reached a point where they don’t know where they stand, what they’re proficient in, if they’re doing fine, whether they’re experts, impostors, or somewhere in the middle, and what would be helpful to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still use FTP and work with PHP 5.2-supported hosts. The most popular theme marketplaces provide products with broken and inconsistent code. The WordPress.org plugin repository accepts plenty of plugins with suspicious consistency and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these issues are recognized publicly in the WordPress community. Some hosts prohibit SSH and allow solely FTP. PHP 5.2 will be supported by Core for a while, which doesn’t motivate hosts to upgrade. Marketplaces earn millions from their top sellers, so they’re not interested in quickly bringing up quality as long as poorly coded themes sell well. There’s also no formal constantly reviewed plugin repository for high quality plugins and no one is actively backing this idea up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the last paragraph as a rant, it’s because it is. It’s meant to be a “wake up call” to clients who don’t know better and service providers who want to become better. While the WordPress Core itself is incredibly stable and flexible, the rest of the infrastructure is mostly poorly coded due to under pricing, lack of skills, and lack of more successful clients interested in backing up WordPress teams and consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of people and plenty of applications of WordPress. Whatever you do, it’s your professional duty to offer the right type of service instead of misleading your clients, and be aware of the other pertinent verticals. Moreover, it’s the only way forward working with reputable organizations and large profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a Successful Client?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-32204&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png?resize=636%2C278&quot; alt=&quot;Success Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeveeaar/2035597695/&quot;&gt;seeveeaar&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige Conference&lt;/a&gt; happened a few weeks ago, and Shane Pearlman from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tri.be/&quot;&gt;Modern Tribe&lt;/a&gt; shared his experience in a presentation entitled, Land the Big Fish: Strategies Acquiring Larger Clients. It’s a motivational talk that outlines different strategies on negotiating and landing larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the session, Pearlman is asked, “What’s in it for me to go through all of that headache to procure bigger brand names?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated at the beginning, working with successful clients is not for everyone. Some people are afraid to leave their comfort zone. Others are too lazy to learn new skills or sometimes doing the same thing repeatedly may be their perfect job. For every other entrepreneur or business player, successful clients are exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each small change is magnified when working with successful clients. Usually, they have a lot of employees, a solid budget for marketing and advertising, a lot of traffic, and various complex requirements that help them attract more leads or automate their processes. T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hey are often respectable and have access to more capital. This allows them to invest more since their return of investment is worth it; while taking a risk due to saving a few bucks could very well ruin their reputation and harm their business. There are several examples of products or companies in the WordPress community that were hacked or where updates caused major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with successful clients is extremely rewarding and exciting, but getting there requires ace skills and solid experience, as well as the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Target Successful Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience with banks, telecoms, automotive, airline brands, large educational institutions and media outlets over the last 12 years as a developer and a technical lead, there are several specific areas where courageous WordPress freelancers and small business owners can focus on if they are aiming for growth and successful clients, but aren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have identified some steps for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/08/8-steps-to-move-from-freelancer-to-successful-company/&quot;&gt;moving from a freelancer to a successful company&lt;/a&gt;. Here is what we should focus on in the WordPress context in order to step up our game, understand our industry better, and start acting professionally if we want to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress is a Vague Term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a WordPress Expert says nothing. You may be a lead developer of WordPress or someone who can memorize the order of all submenus under Settings in the admin dashboard. Both are classified as WordPress experts and that’s what many people don’t realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialize in a given niche and polish your skills. Focus on a specific group of projects &amp;#8211; membership websites, eCommerce stores, multisite installs. Become a know-it-all professional for an extensible plugin such as, BuddyPress, Gravity Forms, or Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the value you are providing and what it corresponds to. Be respectful to the broad community of professionals in your area, learn from them, ask them to be your mentors. Even the best athletes and CEOs have coaches, business mentors, and boards of directors. Find out what it is that you do whether it’s design, development, marketing, or something else and learn the skill inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Installments Don’t Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people offer WordPress services as an add-on to their portfolio of other services without realizing the impact it has on the business. While WordPress is used for plenty of purposes, it’s still a technical platform that comes with its own specific set of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what will happen if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a vulnerable plugin that is exploited and your client’s password is stolen, along with their private details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You forget to protect the media uploader and the client uploads sensitive data. Scanned images of contracts and ID cards end up in the public space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your sitemap plugin indexes protected data since you used a plugin that doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a site and sell it to a client, and due to the terrible choice of plugins, the site crashes miserably and kills the server during a demonstration in front of their big clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a small list of what ifs, but they happen all the time. If you don’t possess the skills or offer the wrong service, this could damage your client’s business. Upping your game and providing solutions instead of websites allows you to take care of the infrastructure, maintenance work, support, development, security, marketing of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, be aware of the consequences and partner up with other agencies and consultants. Complete packages are what successful clients look for and inexperienced people often mess up what others have built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Expert Skills Won’t Cut It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients look for professional skills. They have real problems that can’t be solved with yet another plugin, and they are smart enough to know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the business of configuring themes and installing a few plugins for clients, that won’t do it for successful customers. You need to specialize in code, design, user experience, marketing, or something else that brings real value to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large clients are looking for state of the art designs, performant and secure code, brilliant marketing skills, and growth hacking strategy. Large clients are successful because they are outstanding at what they do, the services they offer, and they appreciate high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context-Specific WordPress Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations take their marketing presence and technical stack seriously. They carefully delegate based on multiple factors. Being in a meeting with a large client typically means discussing a use case together with several people such as, a creative director, VP of marketing, network engineer, and project manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being skillful in your niche and ready to provide value, you have to learn the business processes of your target client. Your idea of a solution may be applicable for small sites, but it may very well be a bad fit based on the company policy or the variety of services used by the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, a creative director may require you to prepare your theme to be ADA Section 508 compliant, which is an accessibility standard required by certain organizations. The VP of marketing may ask for a Hubspot integration with Cvent within your website for proper CRM and meeting request management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network engineer could outline that they need to host the solution on-site, and set up a specific set of web application firewalls and internal web server security rules restricting certain process callbacks. The project manager might share a complicated timeline based on the organization load, holiday schedule, decision maker’s availability, conferences, and various deliverables that need to be presented by different people and other third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are things that we’ve been asked for over the past few months. If you are used to working with a specific host using Apache, prepare for writing documentation and shipping to a restricted server running HHVM. If you use a framework that isn’t accessible, you will need to step back, explore the Section 508 standards, and build something compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic solutions are often not the right fit for large clients. But if you’re determined to learn more and become a better professional, that’s the perfect challenge for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solving More Complex Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to adjust to different environments, working with large clients means solving more complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a mom and pop shop is somewhat broken or down, it’s probably not a big deal if their site receives 100 visits per month. But for a project with tens of millions of views a month and thousands of concurrent users, it is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on larger and heavy platforms often means dealing with a lot of data, complex relationships, and solid traffic. This means that every single line of your code and business decision will inevitably impact the entire system in a way visible to hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to cope with these, you should study your specialty in detail and understand what the impact is of every single change. These skills increase your value and let you face similar challenges and solve problems that the majority of beginners can’t even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn a lot about the entire stack, and get to know hundreds of different rules. At some point you will voluntarily violate those rules, being aware of the fact that some design patterns and best practices don’t solve specific problems. It’s better to denormalize a database or minify a compression algorithm in order to solve a business problem for a large platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just as they say at a music college &amp;#8211; you learn the music theory for three years, and then you throw everything away and start playing jazz. You need to know the entire architecture and strategy first in order to decide how to optimize it in the best possible manner, whether it’s using a best practice or violating one for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaming Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have worked solo or in a small team, you will eventually need to partner up or grow. Either way, large projects are time consuming and require different expertise, and it’s unthinkable for one to know it all. Therefore, you will work with other professionals from more industries, team up and solve more complex problems together, and learn more about their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have thought about mastering a single skill, teaming up with the right people will add a few more skills as an extra perk, which will increase the potential of your main skill as well. Working with financial analysts on a project for a bank helped me to understand the entire model of loans and mortgages, as well as the internal banking policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to learn how loans and interests work in different cases and get acquainted with standardized security regulations at companies in the financial field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-44224&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png?resize=688%2C368&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Security Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/8264582@N06/3383392046&quot;&gt;Two Locks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy and security are important topics that people often misjudge. Working with large clients means more responsibility and higher impact in case of a problem. In the process of building a solution or consulting a reputable organization, you will most likely have to comply with various security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of them may seem unnecessary, there is a reason they exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better it is for you, your clients, and future endeavors. If you’re not using VPNs, SSH keys, two-factor authentication, or voice recognition IDS, this may be a good lesson for you. Why are they needed, what problems do they solve, and how can you apply them to your personal data and existing set of clients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization and Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47877&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg?resize=620%2C400&quot; alt=&quot;BrainyQuote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BrainyQuote
&lt;p&gt;In order to be helpful to large businesses as a consultant, or an agency, you need to be reliable. This may be a result of a number of testimonials, successful track record at previous companies or a good portfolio. It’s always challenging to start with large customers, so improving your skills and working hard in order to become valuable is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being organized and process-oriented is essential to most reputable organizations. The majority of them are more conservative and operate slowly, since a minor mistake could cost them millions or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rely on detailed specifications, scope of work documents, use case diagrams, UX mockups/wireframes, E/R diagrams, and a large list of documents. They include every single detail in their planning &amp;#8211; from holidays for each member of their team, to different dependencies from other service providers and third-party members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients have managed to build a process and scale it in a way that grows their revenue in a predictable way. In order to be able to handle large projects, you need to treat them as a small project that takes longer to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use a project management system and version control properly, define your pricing strategy, make sure to predict all of the delays for both communication and payments. Learn how large organizations operate and do your due diligence upfront in order to avoid surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take anything for granted and don’t assume anything. The more confident you are, the higher the possibility of making a major mistake. There are always new automatic deployment strategies or a DevOps service you haven’t heard of, another massive CSS3 grid, or a growth hacking strategy that you haven’t explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more challenges you face, the more you’ll learn, and be able to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Personal WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=21662</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/22/personal-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve forked the FavePersonal theme to release a few changes that I&amp;#8217;ve made to it for my own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improved Gallery feature, including support for WordPress shortcode galleries. If you&amp;#8217;re uploading photos directly to your gallery post, you can use drag and drop to set the order for them now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Post Formats admin UI is now responsive and works great on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the Social plugin from the theme (requested by WP.org) &amp;#8211; it can still be installed separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make tons of misc. code changes to match new coding standards vs. previous coding standards (and pass the theme check).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/maine-gallery-510x469.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gallery&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-22028&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally hoping to have the modified theme hosted on WordPress.org but after weeks of waiting for review, they responded that features of the theme like &lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24520#comment:4&quot;&gt;choosing colors and post formats&lt;/a&gt; should be done in separate plugins instead. This makes no sense to me as these are core features of the theme, but happily there are great places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that will host the project for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Personal theme is quite assuredly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?url=alexking.org&quot;&gt;mobile-friendly&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it a great fit for the importance Google&amp;#8217;s is placing on mobile-friendly sites lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub or, for you technically minded, grab the reop with git. Just make sure to also grab the submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:alexkingorg/wp-personal.git&lt;br /&gt;
cd wp-personal&lt;br /&gt;
git submodule update --init --recursive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/project/personal&quot;&gt;Personal Theme&lt;/a&gt;. View the project timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordCampus a Conference Devoted to Using WordPress in Higher Education</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47853</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordcampus-a-conference-devoted-to-using-wordpress-in-higher-education</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Higher education is a subject that &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.tv/?s=education&quot;&gt;some WordCamps&lt;/a&gt; have tackled over the years, but what if there was an event entirely devoted to it? That&amp;#8217;s the idea &lt;a href=&quot;http://bamadesigner.com&quot;&gt;Rachel Carden&lt;/a&gt; is proposing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;. The idea started off as a tweet but quickly gained momentum with others in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ooh. Dream with me: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampus?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;: A WordCamp for folks using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordPress&lt;/a&gt; in Higher Education.&quot; I like it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/heweb?src=hash&quot;&gt;#heweb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&quot;&gt;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rachel Carden (@bamadesigner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/628324358126235648&quot;&gt;August 3, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCampus is an event that would cover topics such as, how to manage a large-scale network of faculty blogs, abiding by FERPA regulations, or how to best implement single sign-on that integrates with Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carden &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-ed-conference-wordcampus/&quot;&gt;outlines her idea in detail&lt;/a&gt; on Post Status and says that even though camp is in the event&amp;#8217;s name, it doesn&amp;#8217;t imply that it would be an official WordCamp event. She&amp;#8217;s also open to organizing an event not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in speaking, sponsoring, or attending WordCampus, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;fill out the survey &lt;/a&gt;and help spread the word. The more interest Carden generates, the more likely it is that the WordPress Foundation will back the event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47850</guid>

The post has generated a number of comments from the community. Some of the most popular suggestions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REST API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fields API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Term Meta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcake UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31467&quot;&gt;Ticket 31467&lt;/a&gt; Images should default to not linking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RICG Responsive Images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posts 2 Posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the items suggested are at various stages of development and there&amp;#8217;s no guarantee any of them will make it into WordPress 4.4. However, the comments provide insight into what a lot of developers want in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress Foundation Begins Accepting Applications for the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship</title>

	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-begins-accepting-applications-for-the-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KimParsell.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-36619&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KimParsell.png?resize=655%2C418&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp San Francisco 2014 By Sheri Bigelow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordCamp San Francisco 2014 By Sheri Bigelow
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the WordPress Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/&quot;&gt;created a scholarship&lt;/a&gt; in memory of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away&quot;&gt;Kim Parsell&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate her life and contributions to WordPress. With the date and location secured for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/philadelphia-pa-to-host-wordcamp-us-december-4th-6th&quot;&gt;WordCamp US&lt;/a&gt;, applications for the scholarship are now &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/kim-parsell-scholarship-application&quot;&gt;being accepted&lt;/a&gt; by the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the scholarship are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a scholarship for a woman contributor with financial need who has never attended WordCamp San Francisco before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will cover the ticket cost, flight, and lodging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will not cover things like taxis, meals outside the official event, or airport transportation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One scholarship is awarded per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is funded by the WordPress Foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application deadline is September 2, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decision will be made by September 16, 2015, and applicants contacted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the nature of this scholarship &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/&quot;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt;, applicants must fulfill four requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A woman (this includes trans women)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An active contributor to the WordPress open source project (through one of the contributor teams or as a local meetup/WordCamp organizer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone with financial need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone who has never attended WordCamp San Francisco (the precursor to WCUS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim was an older woman who encouraged others, especially women around the same age group to get involved with WordPress. In light of this, older women are highly encouraged to apply for the scholarship if you meet the other requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim once told me that attending WordCamp San Francisco 2014 was one of the best experiences of her life. It was her first WordCamp San Francisco and although she was unemployed at the time, she was able to attend thanks to financial assistance received from the &lt;a title=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to Jen Mylo, the WordPress Foundation, and Matt Mullenweg for not only creating the scholarship, but for providing the opportunity for others to potentially have the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Hybrid Core 3.0 Experiments With Community-driven Documentation</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47825</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/hybrid-core-3-0-experiments-with-community-driven-documentation</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Core 3.0, developed by Justin Tadlock, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://themehybrid.com/weblog/hybrid-core-version-3-0-mr-reynolds&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;. More than a year in the making, 3.0 has over 269 commits and a slew of new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the release of Hybrid Core 2.0 last year, Tadlock assumed it would be at least two years before he tackled another major release, &amp;#8220;I’d planned on doing minor and patch releases for a while, all along building themes,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;However, a lot has changed in the theming world in just the past year. WordPress has added a lot of cool features for theme authors that were previously handled by Hybrid Core,&amp;#8221; Tadlock said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadlock wants the project to feel fresh and one way to do that is to remove features that are handled natively by WordPress. Features removed from Hybrid Core include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atomic hooks functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random Custom Background extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Featured Header extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaner Caption extension (handled in WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop title/description (replaced by WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pagination (replaced by WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s clear that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/&quot;&gt;customizer in WordPress is here to stay&lt;/a&gt; and will be an important part of the project&amp;#8217;s future. Hybrid Core 3.0 adds a variety of enhancements that make the customizer more flexible, these include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color Palette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Checkbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropdown Terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio Image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Select.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a few customizer setting classes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array Map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image Data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tadlock Experiments with Community-driven Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the largest changes to the Hybrid project is opening up documentation to be community-driven. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/wiki&quot;&gt;Hybrid Core wiki&lt;/a&gt; hosted on Github is now open to contributions from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadlock believes that this will drive adoption of the framework by more theme authors, &amp;#8220;The more developers we have using and contributing to the project, the better,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the community responds well to the experiment, it will allow Tadlock to focus on longer-form tutorials for club members, something he feels he&amp;#8217;s better at doing than reference style documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Core 3.0 includes a number of features, bug fixes, and improvements. If you want to see all of the changes in 3.0, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/blob/master/changelog.md&quot;&gt;lengthy changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress 4.3 “Billie” Named After Jazz Singer Billie Holiday Is Available for Download</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47803</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-billie-named-after-jazz-singer-billie-holiday-is-available-for-download</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After four months of development led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://konstantin.obenland.it/&quot;&gt;Konstantin Obenland&lt;/a&gt;, WordPress 4.3 &amp;#8220;Billie&amp;#8221; named after jazz singer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billieholiday.com/&quot;&gt;Billie Holiday&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/billie/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;. This release features menus in the customizer, strong passwords by default, site icons, and variety of other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Menus in the Customizer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now create, add, and edit menus in the customizer while previewing changes to your site in real-time. Unlike other parts of the customizer, previewing menus should be fast as it uses a new hybrid transport layer. Weston Ruter, who contributed to fast previews in the customizer &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/fast-previewing-changes-to-menus-in-the-customizer/&quot;&gt;explains the approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to enable fast previewing of menu changes by default. So we implemented a &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;refresh&lt;/code&gt; hybrid approach which uses &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt; to sync the menus settings to the preview, and then the preview does an Ajax request to render just the contents of the menu container, and this Ajax response is then inserted into the DOM to replace the previous menu container. The technical name for this approach we have been calling &amp;#8216;partial refresh&amp;#8217;, but you can call it fast preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, previewing menus in most themes should be a fast experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/menu-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47806&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/menu-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Menu Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Menu Customizer
&lt;h2&gt;Strong Passwords by Default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Jaquith &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/&quot;&gt;led the effort&lt;/a&gt; to improve the way passwords are chosen and changed in WordPress. On the account management page, clicking the Generate Password button generates a strong password by default. The password strength meter is better integrated into the password field which lets users know immediately when their password is weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/better-passwords.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47807&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/better-passwords.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Better Passwords in WordPress&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Better Passwords in WordPress
&lt;p&gt;The same interface is on the add new user screen, the password reset screen, and the WordPress install screen. While WordPress doesn&amp;#8217;t require users to have a strong password, it does everything it can to encourage users to choose one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, WordPress no longer emails passwords and password reset links expire after 24 hours. When your password or e-mail changes, WordPress sends you an email so if someone hijacks your browser session and changes these items, you’ll be notified that it happened, and you can take action. You can disable these e-mails via the &lt;code&gt;send_pass_change_email&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;send_email_change_email&lt;/code&gt; filters by setting them to false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Icons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icons&lt;/a&gt; are images that represent a website across multiple platforms. You can configure your Site Icon in the Site Identity panel within the customizer where you can upload a 512X512 sized image. This image will be used for browsers, iOS, Android, and Microsoft devices when a visitor bookmarks your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;h2&gt;Text Patterns, Quick Link Toolbar, and Word Count Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editor in WordPress 4.3 has &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/text-patterns-and-the-quick-link-toolbar-in-wordpress-4-3&quot;&gt;undergone more improvements&lt;/a&gt; with text shortcuts, a quick link toolbar, and word count changes. Text patterns or text shortcuts allow you to quickly add unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, and blockquotes without having to use a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When starting a new paragraph with one of these formatting shortcuts followed by a space, the formatting will be applied automatically. Press Backspace or Escape to undo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the visual editor in WordPress 4.3, typing &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and hitting the space bar will generate a bulleted list. Typing &lt;code&gt;1. &lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;1)&lt;/code&gt; and hitting space will generate a numbered list. If you don’t want to create these lists or do so in error, clicking the undo button or hitting &lt;code&gt;ctrl/cmd+z&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt; will undo the text pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a paragraph with two to six number signs &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a heading. Similarly, the greater-than symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;## = H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### = H3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### = H4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;##### = H5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;###### = H6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick Link Preview Toolbar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click a link in the WordPress 4.3 visual editor, a small inline link toolbar displays the full URL with buttons to edit or remove it. This avoids having to use the Insert/edit link modal window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47792&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png?resize=571%2C102&quot; alt=&quot;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3
&lt;p&gt;Word and character counts have also changed in WordPress 4.3. Instead of updating counts when pressing enter or return, it will refresh when you stop typing. A lot more characters that shouldn’t be counted as words are excluded. Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe, WordPress core contributor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/wordcharacter-count-updates-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;lists other notable changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to the Admin Bar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 moves the Customize link to the top-level menu of the admin bar. This link opens the customizer, allowing you to manage menus, appearance, and widgets through the customizer interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46995 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png?resize=429%2C232&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46996 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png?resize=428%2C202&quot; alt=&quot;WP43AdminBar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Admin Bar
&lt;p&gt;The Dashboard, Themes, Widgets, and Menus links take users to their corresponding admin pages in the backend of WordPress. This makes it clear which interface users are about to enter. The enhancement is a result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32678&quot;&gt;ticket #32678&lt;/a&gt; where Helen Hou-Sandí and other WordPress core contributors discussed ways to improve the context of each link over the course of five weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Noteworthy Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-improves-user-search-and-turns-comments-off-on-pages-by-default&quot;&gt;Comments are turned off on pages by default&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Singular.php was added to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/06/singular-php-new-theme-template-in-wordpress-4-3/&quot;&gt;WordPress template hierarchy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/31/headings-in-admin-screens-change-in-wordpress-4-3/&quot;&gt;Header tags were updated through the admin screens&lt;/a&gt;. Plugin, theme, and framework developers, please change the main heading from an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; into an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Also, check the rest of your heading structure to ensure it’s semantic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/24/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;Multisite focused changes in 4.3&lt;/a&gt; specifically, the introduction of get_main_network_id()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/30/get_transient-is-now-more-strict-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;get_transient() is now more strict in 4.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/old-distraction-free-writing-code-removed-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;Distraction Free Writing (DFW) code has been removed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code that powered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/30/legacy-theme-preview-removed-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;old theme preview has been removed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/08/list-table-changes-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;List tables have undergone API and UI changes&lt;/a&gt;, with the introduction of a primary column concept and easier subclassing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 is the result of hundreds of paid and non-paid volunteers working tirelessly to improve the software used on more than 24% of the web. If you experience any issues with WordPress 4.3, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;report them on the support forums&lt;/a&gt;. Volunteers are watching support threads closely and if warranted, will create a thread listing known issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enjoy the full upgrade experience, I encourage you to listen to Lady sings The Blues by Billie Holiday as you upgrade your WordPress sites.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Text Patterns and the Quick Link Toolbar in WordPress 4.3</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47790</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/text-patterns-and-the-quick-link-toolbar-in-wordpress-4-3</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/QuickLinkToolbarFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47794&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/QuickLinkToolbarFeaturedImage.png?resize=675%2C209&quot; alt=&quot;Quick Link Toolbar Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/34547181@N00/4309431757&quot;&gt;metal chain&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 is on schedule to be released &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-3-project-schedule/&quot;&gt;August 18th&lt;/a&gt; and contains a number of improvements. Among the enhancements to the visual editor are text patterns. Text patterns or text shortcuts allow you to quickly add unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, and blockquotes without having to use a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the visual editor in WordPress 4.3, typing &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and hitting the space bar will generate a bulleted list. Typing &lt;code&gt;1. &lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;1)&lt;/code&gt; and hitting space will generate a numbered list. If you don&amp;#8217;t want to create these lists or do so in error, clicking the undo button or hitting &lt;code&gt;ctrl/cmd+z&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt; will undo the text pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a paragraph with two to six number signs &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a heading. Similarly, the greater-than symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;## = H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### = H3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### = H4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;##### = H5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;###### = H6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a few tries to figure out but once I got the hang of it, I discovered that I prefer using text patterns versus clicking the appropriate button in the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the blockquote text pattern places text into a blockquote and automatically closes it while also starting a new paragraph. Traditionally, I highlight text and click on the blockquote button in the editor. Often times, I have to visit the text editor and close the blockquote to start a new paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Boren, WordPress core lead developer, created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/01/editor-enhancements-in-4-3-%E2%9C%A8/&quot;&gt;following video&lt;/a&gt; which shows the text patterns in action on a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Previews of Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.2 included a subtle but convenient feature for adding links to text. Pasting the URL to highlighted text automatically turns it into a link. The problem is that there isn&amp;#8217;t an easy way to preview the URL without opening it in a new browser tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click a link in the WordPress 4.3 visual editor, a small inline link toolbar displays the full URL with buttons to edit or remove it. This avoids having to use the Insert/edit link modal window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47792&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png?resize=571%2C102&quot; alt=&quot;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preview Links in The WordPress 4.3 Visual Editor
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to Word and Character Counts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word and character counts have also changed in WordPress 4.3. Instead of updating counts when pressing enter or return, it will refresh when you stop typing. A lot more characters that shouldn&amp;#8217;t be counted as words are excluded. Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe, WordPress core contributor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/wordcharacter-count-updates-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;lists other notable changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;character&lt;/strong&gt; count, we no longer exclude any of these characters. This means that numbers and common western punctuation are no longer excluded compared to 4.2. Emoji and other astral characters are now counted as one character instead of two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a new type &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt;, in addition to words and characters, that will count characters including spaces. This seemed necessary for Japanese and maybe other languages. This is now &lt;code&gt;character_including_spaces&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;character_excluding_spaces&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcodes and HTML comments are now excluded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view details and a summary of all the work that went into improving word counts, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30966&quot;&gt;ticket #30966&lt;/a&gt; on trac. As someone who uses the WordPress content editor for a living, I&amp;#8217;m anxiously looking forward to utilizing these enhancements on an everyday basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: A WordPress conference for higher education: coming to a campus near you?</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14001</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-ed-conference-wordcampus/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Thus far, there have been numerous niche WordPress conferences aiming toward for-profit initiatives and geared toward businesses, marketers, or eCommerce site owners. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://bamadesigner.com/&quot;&gt;Rachel Carden&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s concept for a niche, education focused, non-profit event is unique and I&amp;#8217;d love to see it happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As she notes, universities have unique challenges for managing websites and are also great candidates for utilizing WordPress to its full potential. What follows is her pitch and public brainstorming session on what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org/&quot;&gt;higher education focused WordPress conference&lt;/a&gt; might look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started with a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ooh. Dream with me: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampus?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;: A WordCamp for folks using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordPress&lt;/a&gt; in Higher Education.&quot; I like it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/heweb?src=hash&quot;&gt;#heweb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&quot;&gt;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rachel Carden (@bamadesigner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/628324358126235648&quot;&gt;August 3, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCamp U.S. made a big announcement that was all over Twitter, Chris Lema tweeted what we were all thinking, and I couldn’t help but start daydreaming about the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I’m a web designer and developer with a passion for all things WordPress, especially using WordPress to build the world of higher ed web. Having spent the last 8 years working in higher education, I’m always looking for ways to utilize the power of WordPress to fulfill my campus’s needs and to help its communication grow, whether it’s using the powerful CMS to stretch limited resources or using its new API capabilities to share information, and break down silos, across campus departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love attending WordCamps and other WordPress-related events, but the issues we generally encounter in higher ed are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like online businesses or blogging, higher ed is a world of its own with unique challenges, content, stakeholders, and target audiences. In our world, we don’t worry so much about which eCommerce plugin is best. Instead, we’re more concerned with things like how to manage a large-scale network of faculty blogs, making sure we’re abiding with FERPA regulations, or wondering how to best implement single sign-on that integrates with Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m proposing a new event in the WordPress community: a conference focused on using WordPress in the world of higher education. I call the idea “WordCampus”. (Kind of a perfect name, right? How did nobody think of this before?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name “WordCampus” came to me from a tweet and does not, at this point, imply it would be an official WordCamp event. If needed, I’m open to organizing an event that is not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation. This is a detail that remains to be seen, but honestly, at this point, all details remain to be seen. A WordCamp representative has confirmed that a user group specific WordCamp is possible, but I would need to prove that it could draw a crowd. That’s why I need your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a WordPress conference for higher ed is something you would be interested in (whether it’s as an attendee, speaker, planner, sponsor, or all of the above), I invite you to read a few of my thoughts, share yours in the comments, and visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org/&quot;&gt;wordcampus.org&lt;/a&gt; to show your support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cost and fee consideration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like your usual WordCamp, the goal for this event is to keep the costs and ticket price as low as possible. The point of this event is professional development and community, not profit. The phrases “big budget” and “higher ed” don’t generally appear in the same sentence anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of higher ed-oriented web conferences can run upwards of $500 so an inexpensive, but valuable, event would be attractive for most higher education web professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unique sponsorship opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having sponsors to help with costs would be crucial and I am open to all kinds of support, whether it’s monetary or in-kind. Sponsoring an event like WordCampus would be a unique way to get an organization’s name in front of one of the best communities &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of WordPress that &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; WordPress all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of higher education, you often have limited resources, so there are plenty of opportunities for third party products or services like hosting, themes, plugins, custom design, accessibility consulting, and custom development, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Location is a factor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location could be a sticking point, as high travel costs might be a deal breaker for many WordCampus attendees. The beauty of local WordCamps is that they are tied to a geographical region and therefore, for most attendees, have limited travel requirements. This could be a problem for an event that is not tied to a specific region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue wise, universities have beautiful facilities, so I’d love to host the event on an actual college campus and, if the hosting university could donate the space in kind, this would be a huge cost saver. The most preferable universities would also be located near a major airport to help reduce travel time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m really dreaming big, it would be great to find numerous universities that would be willing to host and, therefore, we could have regional WordCampus events spread across the country. I don’t think this is outside the realm of possibility, but would depend on interest and attendance. I&amp;#8217;m certainly interested in hearing from anyone that may be interested in hosting WordCampus at their university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A big target audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a wide variety of WordPress users in higher ed, from the university-level WordPress developers and administrators, to the users who run WordPress for a college, to the faculty members using WordPress as a learning tool, and any students who’d love to learn a thing or two (they are our future, you know). That’s not even including content strategists, designers, social media managers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCampus has the potential to attract a variety of users who could inspire a multitude of topics and professional development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A broad variety of topics, even within the education umbrella&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of topics, these could also run the gamut from higher ed marketing and content strategy to infrastructure, managing multi-author blogs, and streamlining application processes. Accessibility should also be a featured topic as federally funded institutions are required by law to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I see the structure of higher ed as tailor-made for the open source mindset and would love to hear someone encourage collaboration and openness by comparing the ideologies of open source with the inner workings of higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Event timing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As organizing something of this magnitude takes time, I’m looking at a 2016 booking. What time of the year in 2016, however, remains to be seen. There are obviously a lot of variables at play, from venue availability to which time of the year is best for our target attendees. In higher ed, you need time to clear your schedule and request funding, so I’d want to allow for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the middle of the semester is best for most higher ed professionals, but this can vary depending on their field. And if we’re being honest, the majority of fall might be out of the question because of football season. We’ve included a straw poll &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org&quot;&gt;on the event landing page&lt;/a&gt; to help us gauge which time of year might be best for those interested in attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read through my proposal and hopefully interested parties will have a few additional thoughts for the comments. If you would like be notified of any future developments, or show your support for the project, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org&quot;&gt;wordcampus.org&lt;/a&gt; to share a little bit of information. And don’t forget to tell your friends!&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I had great BBQ in San Francisco last week at a new place called Smokestack. The brisket was on-point, and competitive with anything I&amp;#8217;ve had in Texas. &lt;a href=&quot;http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2014/05/08/magnolia-opens-dogpatch-brewery-and-its-restaurant-smokestack/#photo-451076&quot;&gt;This review in the SF Chronicle covers things pretty well&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;#8217;re hankering for some great Southern food in SF this is the place to check out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WP REST API 1.2.3 Patches XSS Vulnerability</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47770</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-1-2-3-patches-xss-vulnerability</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WP REST API version 1.2.3 and 2.0 Beta 4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/14/rest-api-v1-2-3-and-v2-0-b4/&quot;&gt;address a security issue&lt;/a&gt; that affects sites running 1.2 or 2.0 beta. This release fixes a potential XSS vulnerability related to JSONP support in 1.2 and 2.0 of the API. Automatic updates are in progress for 1.2.3 but if your site hasn&amp;#8217;t automatically updated, the team suggests updating manually as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the security release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/&quot;&gt;2.0 Beta 4&lt;/a&gt; includes a number of enhancements, some of which break backwards compatibility. Developers and beta testers should read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/releases/tag/2.0-beta4&quot;&gt;detailed changelog&lt;/a&gt; and release notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Nick Haskins Rebrands Lasso to Editus</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47763</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/nick-haskins-rebrands-lasso-to-editus</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In mid July, Nick Haskins, founder and lead developer of Lasso, was served a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/nick-haskins-receives-cease-and-desist-letter-for-violating-lassosoft-trademarks&quot;&gt;cease and desist letter&lt;/a&gt; from LassoSoft. LassoSoft argued that Lasso violates its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=861046116&quot;&gt;registered trademarks&lt;/a&gt; and causes confusion to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EdiusFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-47764&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EdiusFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C182&quot; alt=&quot;Edit us Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Instead of fighting litigation, Haskins decided to rebrand the product from Lasso to&lt;a href=&quot;https://edituswp.com/lasso-is-now-editus/&quot;&gt; Editus.&lt;/a&gt; The name was suggested by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iklektive.com/&quot;&gt;Gavin Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;. According to Haskins, the only references to the name is a band in Costa Rica and a directory in Luxemburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a new domain and cloned website, Lasso 0.9.8 is available for download which includes the renaming of various admin menu items that used the term Lasso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lasso 0.9.8 Requires a Manual Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haskins says users will need to update to 0.9.8 manually because of the switch in domain names but automatic updates will return after 0.9.8,  &amp;#8220;Updates after 0.9.8, will continue to be automatic, just as the way they were before,&amp;#8221; Haskins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesopinteractive LLC is &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickhaskins.com/2015/07/on-life-and-family/&quot;&gt;looking for a buyer&lt;/a&gt; but after receiving low offers, Haskins has decided to use a broker to facilitate the sale. The broker requested that the rebrand of Lasso be completed before proceeding with the sale process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Editus has a nice ring to it, what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Death of Mobile Web</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45292</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/08/death-of-mobile-web/</link>
	<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile web and mobile in-app behaviour are not binary. When users are in the facebook app, they spend a tremendous amount of time accessing the mobile web through facebook’s own in-app browser. The same for twitter and others. We enter social apps for discovery and then access the mobile web while still in-app. It is a mistake to conflate time spent on the mobile web with time spent in a traditional browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen. Tony Haile of Chartbeat: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonyhaile.com/2015/08/11/a-correction-around-the-death-of-the-mobile-web/&quot;&gt;A correction around the death of the mobile web.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 Adds Statistical Insights</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47740</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-version-5-4-adds-statistical-insights</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=&amp;ct=&quot;&gt;available on the app store&lt;/a&gt; and includes a couple of new features. To compliment the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-5-3-released-with-refreshed-stats-and-a-new-layout-for-posts-and-pages&quot;&gt;improvements to stats in 5.3&lt;/a&gt;, 5.4 adds a new stats screen called insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insights is similar to the Right Now widget in the WordPress dashboard in that it displays a summary of key statistics for a site including, total number of published posts, views, visitors, and the best traffic day. There&amp;#8217;s also a section that displays the current day&amp;#8217;s stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_7433.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47744&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_7433.png?resize=282%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Stat Insights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stat Insights
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 5.4, you could only add images to posts that were stored on the device. WordPress for iOS 5.4 adds the ability to insert images from the WordPress media library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add an image from the WordPress media library, select media library from the menu at the top of the screen. If you have a lot of items in the media library, it may take a few minutes to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WPiPhoneMediaLibrary.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-47746&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WPiPhoneMediaLibrary.png?resize=500%2C399&quot; alt=&quot;WP For iOS 5.4 Media Library Selection&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other improvements include the ability to search the My Sites list and viewing embedded images in comments. This makes it easier to see the full context of a comment without having to view it in a different part of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the team fixed a bug that caused the app to not restore its state properly. WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=&amp;ct=&quot;&gt;free and available&lt;/a&gt; on the app store. If you encounter any issues, you&amp;#8217;re encouraged to report them on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ios.forums.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress for iOS support forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Short Interview With Nikolay Bachiyski WordPress’ Security Czar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47728</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/short-interview-with-nikolay-bachiyski-wordpress-security-czar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While on stage at &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Europe&lt;/a&gt; answering a question related to WordPress’ security track record, Matt Mullenweg named &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/nbachiyski&quot;&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski&lt;/a&gt; as the first Security Czar for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Bachiyski to learn why the role was created and what its purpose is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the responsibilities of your new role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responsibilities are to coordinate the security efforts of&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;mostly with incident response and to make sure we respond quickly, have solid fixes, and make sure everyone involved is informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What circumstances led to this role&amp;#8217;s creation?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing too spicy around the creation of the role. As the volume of requests increased, we realized a bit more structure would be helpful so that we are more focused and use our resources wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you only handle security issues for the open source project or will you also help with Automattic’s bounty program as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other colleagues at Automattic who are responsible for the bounty program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are the connections and trust you’ve established over the last 11 years to your role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offline relationships are very important in an online community and I am lucky to know many of the members of the security team in person. This definitely makes working with them easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn More About the WordPress Security Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;d like to learn more about who&amp;#8217;s on the WordPress security team, what they do, and how they handle security releases, listen to my interview with Gary Pendergast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pendergast who works for Automattic, is a WordPress core contributor, and a member of the WordPress core security team. In the interview, we discuss what happened behind the scenes before &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/plugin-developers-demand-a-better-security-release-process-after-wordpress-4-2-3-breaks-thousands-of-websites&quot;&gt;4.2.3 was released&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Avis GPS</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45255</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/08/avis-gps/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After an amazing WordCamp Scranton on Saturday I was heading to a friend&amp;#8217;s birthday on Long Island on Sunday, a few people were surprised I had flown from New York and said driving took about the same amount of time when you factor in all the airport hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Google Mapped it and it did look like it was only 5-6 hours from Scranton to where I was going. Being a born and raised Texan, I love a good drive, and I probably haven&amp;#8217;t had a proper road trip since my sister&amp;#8217;s birthday a few years ago when we went up Highway 1. I&amp;#8217;ve also never driven on the East Coast, and it seemed like there were some really pretty parks and lakes in between Scranton and Long Island so I ended up going to the airport anyway because that&amp;#8217;s where the rental cars were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avis.com/&quot;&gt;Avis&lt;/a&gt;. They try harder. &lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/s.ma.tt/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=604&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt; One thing they do that&amp;#8217;s pretty cool is sell  decent cables, USB wall chargers, and car chargers for a cheap price right at the check-in desk. (I always carry my own car charger, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Incase-Speed-Charger-Lightning-Cable/dp/B00P7Y6M2Y/&quot;&gt;this is my current pick&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s super-handy in Ubers as well.) Amazingly though they still try to give you one of those Garmin GPS units that&amp;#8217;s worse than your smartphone in every possible way. I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s a money maker, otherwise the only reasonable thing to do would be provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O5JARCI&quot;&gt;a smartphone mount&lt;/a&gt; (or have one already set up in the car) rather than saddling people with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/559938/ref=zg_b_bs_559938_1&quot;&gt;archaic, non-networked navigation device&lt;/a&gt; that has no idea about construction or traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up going to a Walmart that was nearby to pick up a car mount (price, $12) that ended up being a life-saver for the trip. &lt;strong&gt;I also believe that every person in tech should visit Walmart at least once a year, and spend time in their technology section.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s good to understand and see how people who don&amp;#8217;t live for technology every day interact with it. It&amp;#8217;s eye-opening, and it&amp;#8217;s handy to know what&amp;#8217;s in stock in case you need 50 feet of ethernet at 4 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping the car off in Manhattan, it looks like they charged me $20 for a GPS which I don&amp;#8217;t even have, so now going to need to sort out both the fee and the &amp;#8220;missing&amp;#8221; GPS system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl; dr: Smart car rental companies should ditch the GPS, provide smartphone mounts instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Organizing Team Explains Why Philadelphia Should Host WordCamp US</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47699</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/organizing-team-explains-why-philadelphia-should-host-wordcamp-us</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When organizing teams in different &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2015-now-accepting-applications-for-host-city&quot;&gt;cities applied to host&lt;/a&gt; WordCamp US earlier this year, they provided a substantial amount of information through the application process. While &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/philadelphia-pa-to-host-wordcamp-us-december-4th-6th&quot;&gt;Philadelphia will host&lt;/a&gt; the event in 2015 and 2016, their application is not public information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juliana Reyes, who writes for &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly&quot;&gt;Technical.ly Philly&lt;/a&gt;, acquired and &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly/2015/08/11/wordcamp-us-philadelphia-wordpress-devs/&quot;&gt;published a few&lt;/a&gt; of the responses from the organizing team&amp;#8217;s application, specifically questions four, nine, ten, and eleven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question nine on the application asks, why do you think your city should host WordCamp US 2015? The organizing team responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Philadelphia is the birthplace of our nation. The United States started here, and so should WordCamp US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’re ideally situated on the East Coast between New York and Washington DC, and the halfway point between the West Coast and parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With a population of 1.5 million, it is the 5th largest city in North America, and is a cultural hub for all things food, music, art, and technology. It is well-known for its many excellent medical and educational facilities, including the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Drexel University, and the University of the Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With over 1,200 daily inbound and outbound flights, Philadelphia is easy to reach from anywhere in the world. The average hotel room and cost of living, is far below any other major East Coast city, and nowhere else has cheesesteaks like we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve yet to visit Philadelphia but one thing I&amp;#8217;ve learned is that residents take their reputation for cheesesteaks seriously. Be sure to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly/2015/08/11/wordcamp-us-philadelphia-wordpress-devs/&quot;&gt;the post&lt;/a&gt; to see the team&amp;#8217;s responses to the other three questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: ThemeConf a Conference for Front-End Developers and Designers September 2nd-4th, 2015</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47686</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/themeconf-a-conference-for-front-end-developers-and-designers-september-2nd-4th-2015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ThemeConfLogo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-47688&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ThemeConfLogo.png?resize=215%2C181&quot; alt=&quot;ThemeConf Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://themeconf.com/&quot;&gt;ThemeConf&lt;/a&gt; is a new conference set to take place September 2nd-4th, 2015, in Keswick, England aimed at front-end developers and designers. Confirmed speakers include a handful of Automattic theme wranglers, Noel Tock of Human Made, freelancer Adam Onishi, and Chris Hutchinson of The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session schedule is expected to be released later this week however, here are some of the topics that will be covered at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Craft, workflow and best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser performance and developer tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and photography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript and REST APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Lenox and Tammie Lister, who are the primary organizers of the event, originally came up with the idea for ThemeConf at the Automattic UK Christmas dinner, &amp;#8220;Lenox wanted to bring a conference to where he lives in the Lake district and I wanted to do one focusing on themes,&amp;#8221; Lister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two have been planning the event since January of this year. Although most of the confirmed speakers work with WordPress, ThemeConf is not dedicated to it, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s geared to those making themes in general and working on the front end. We have tried hard not to focus on WordPress,&amp;#8221; Lister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.to/themeconf/2015&quot;&gt;Tickets for ThemeConf&lt;/a&gt; are £49 and £99 respectively. The £49 tickets are for speaker sessions only while the £99 tickets include access to a workshop on using the REST API and lunch. Accommodations in the Lake District two hours from Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Liverpool and Leeds are available through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keswick.org/&quot;&gt;Keswick.org.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;An incredible story: &lt;a href=&quot;http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/tech-firm-ubiquiti-suffers-46m-cyberheist/&quot;&gt;Tech Firm Ubiquiti Suffers $46M Cyberheist&lt;/a&gt;. Notable for two reasons: I love Ubiquiti&amp;#8217;s products, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubnt.com/products/#enterprise&quot;&gt;especially their Unifi line&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;#8217;ve never heard of phishing getting so much from a single victim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Surpasses One Billion Total Downloads</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47673</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-surpasses-one-billion-total-downloads</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The WordPress project achieved a milestone earlier today as the official WordPress plugin directory &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/&quot;&gt;surpassed one billion&lt;/a&gt; total downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1billiondownloads.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47674&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1billiondownloads.png?resize=944%2C312&quot; alt=&quot;One billion total plugin downloads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;More than one billion total downloads
&lt;p&gt;According to Scott Reilly who helps maintain WordPress.org, we&amp;#8217;ll never know which plugin generated the one billionth download. That&amp;#8217;s because WordPress.org doesn&amp;#8217;t log information that matches downloads to plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A download counter exists for each plugin for each day and the total amount is the summation of all those daily download counts,&amp;#8221; Reilly said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As WordPress&amp;#8217; &lt;a href=&quot;http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all&quot;&gt;market share&lt;/a&gt; continues to grow, so does the amount of downloads from the plugin directory. The following numbers are the total amount of downloads from March 2006 to August 2015. This year, the directory is on pace to serve more than 300 million downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 2006  191,567&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2007  2,845,802&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2008  15,130,856&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2009  49,822,116&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2010  72,342,598&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2011  108,501,907&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2012  141,609,682&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2013  182,236,517&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014  241,142,505&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 2015 to August 2015  186,243,700&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took nine years for the plugin directory to reach one billion downloads, when do you think it will reach two billion?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: SkiPress a Week Long Excursion in the French Alps</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47654</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/skipress-a-week-long-excursion-in-the-french-alps</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SkiPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-47658&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SkiPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=852%2C269&quot; alt=&quot;SkiPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you enjoy skiing and WordPress, mark your calendars for &lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;SkiPress&lt;/a&gt;, November 21-28, 2015. SkiPress is a week long excursion to Serre Chevalier, a ski resort in the French Alps. The cottage can hold up to 15 people where attendees can ski, discuss WordPress, develop code, or disconnect from technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;Bernard-Jacquet&lt;/a&gt; who writes for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-spread.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WP-spread&lt;/a&gt;, and helps organize the local WordPress meetup in Grenoble, France, is organizing the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooms at the cottage cost 350 euros. This amount covers the room for a week plus dinner at two restaurants. Prepare to bring some extra cash as the bus, skipass, and ski rental are additional costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s not an official deadline to book a room but the sooner you book the better. If you&amp;#8217;re interested in booking a room, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;contact Berard-Jacquet&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible so he can make arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Richard Best Publishes Human Readable Version of the GPLv2 License</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47645</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/richard-best-publishes-human-readable-version-of-the-gplv2-license</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is licensed under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/&quot;&gt;GPLv2&lt;/a&gt; and the four freedoms it allows is considered to be its &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/&quot;&gt;Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt;. The four freedoms are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to benefit from your changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more to the GPL than the four freedoms listed above however, the license details can be difficult to read and decipher. Richard Best, a qualified lawyer in New Zealand, England, and Wales, has published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpandlegalstuff.com/a-human-readable-summary-of-the-gpl/&quot;&gt;human readable summary&lt;/a&gt; of the GPL license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by how Creative Commons offers a &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot;&gt;human readable version&lt;/a&gt; of its licenses, the summary explains the core concepts of the GPL and outlines the position in relation to copying, distribution, fees, modifications/derivative works, distributing non-source forms, termination, and downstream licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to note that the document is not endorsed by the Free Software Foundation nor a substitute for the full license text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GPLSummarySample2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47647&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GPLSummarySample2.png?resize=705%2C554&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of the human readable summary of the GPL&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sample of the human readable summary of the GPL
&lt;p&gt;I encourage everyone participating in the WordPress ecosystem to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/&quot;&gt;full license&lt;/a&gt; text at least once. However, the summary does a good job explaining the core components of the GPL without having to dig into the license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions concerning the GPL, I suggest seeking legal council with a lawyer familiar with software licensing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
