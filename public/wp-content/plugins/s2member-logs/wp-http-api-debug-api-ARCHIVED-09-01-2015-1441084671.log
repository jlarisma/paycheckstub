<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard.

<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.3:</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Site icons for all</em><br />
<em>Live preview menu changes</em><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.2 is now available. This is a <strong>critical security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>Version 4.2.2 addresses two security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Genericons icon font package, which is used in a number of popular themes and plugins, contained an HTML file vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. All affected themes and plugins hosted on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> (including the Twenty Fifteen default theme) have been updated today by the WordPress security team to address this issue by removing this nonessential file. To help protect other Genericons usage, WordPress 4.2.2 proactively scans the wp-content directory for this HTML file and removes it. Reported by Robert Abela of <a href="http://netsparker.com">Netsparker</a>.</li>
<li>WordPress versions 4.2 and earlier are affected by a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/">critical cross-site scripting vulnerability</a>, which could enable anonymous users to compromise a site. WordPress 4.2.2 includes a comprehensive fix for this issue. Reported separately by Rice Adu and Tong Shi from Baidu[X-team].</li>
</ul>
<p>The release also includes hardening for a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability when using the visual editor. This issue was reported by Mahadev Subedi.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.2 also contains fixes for 13 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.2">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=32418&amp;stop_rev=32324">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.2</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.2.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.2:</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.3 make it even easier to format your content and customize your site.</p>
<p><iframe width='692' height='389' src='https://videopress.com/embed/T54Iy7Tw?hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1435166243'></script></p>
<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>The Team</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.3:</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Site icons for all</em><br />
<em>Live preview menu changes</em><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.2 is now available. This is a <strong>critical security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>Version 4.2.2 addresses two security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Genericons icon font package, which is used in a number of popular themes and plugins, contained an HTML file vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. All affected themes and plugins hosted on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> (including the Twenty Fifteen default theme) have been updated today by the WordPress security team to address this issue by removing this nonessential file. To help protect other Genericons usage, WordPress 4.2.2 proactively scans the wp-content directory for this HTML file and removes it. Reported by Robert Abela of <a href="http://netsparker.com">Netsparker</a>.</li>
<li>WordPress versions 4.2 and earlier are affected by a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/">critical cross-site scripting vulnerability</a>, which could enable anonymous users to compromise a site. WordPress 4.2.2 includes a comprehensive fix for this issue. Reported separately by Rice Adu and Tong Shi from Baidu[X-team].</li>
</ul>
<p>The release also includes hardening for a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability when using the visual editor. This issue was reported by Mahadev Subedi.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.2 also contains fixes for 13 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.2">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=32418&amp;stop_rev=32324">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.2</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.2.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.2:</p>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress.com Unveils the Action Bar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47954</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-unveils-the-action-bar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/new-action-bar/&quot;&gt;unveiled a new user interface&lt;/a&gt; called the Action Bar. It&amp;#8217;s a bar that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen for logged in users and is accessible from any device. The bar performs multiple tasks depending on the page you&amp;#8217;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47955&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png?resize=1025%2C627&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Action Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress Action Bar
&lt;p&gt;When on a WordPress.com powered site that you&amp;#8217;re not following, the bar turns into a Follow button. Clicking the follow button will notify you of new posts published on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47956&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png?resize=192%2C60&quot; alt=&quot;Action Bar Follow Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Action Bar Follow Button
&lt;p&gt;If you click the three dots to the right, you&amp;#8217;ll see a variety of options depending upon the page you&amp;#8217;re viewing. If it&amp;#8217;s the homepage, you&amp;#8217;ll see links to download the theme the site uses, report the content, or manage the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re browsing a specific post on a WordPress.com site, you&amp;#8217;ll see an additional link to copy a shortlink for quick and easy sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47957&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png?resize=265%2C319&quot; alt=&quot;Easily Share Posts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easily Share Posts
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com and are logged in, the Follow button turns into a Customize button. This link provides a quick way to enter the Customizer. There&amp;#8217;s also an Edit link if you&amp;#8217;re browsing a published post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47958&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png?resize=307%2C348&quot; alt=&quot;Edit and Customize Links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Edit and Customize Links
&lt;p&gt;If the action bar is too big and you want to minimize it, click the three dots and select the option to Collapse the bar. It will shrink the bar into squares and get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the action bar is the ability to quickly see and download a theme used on a WordPress.com site. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for WordPress.com specific sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailypost.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The Daily Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What annoys me about the action bar is that it disappears when I scroll down. I caught myself scrolling down to read a post and when I looked for the edit button to fix a typo, the action bar was gone. I think it should stay on the screen at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to see the Edit link in the action bar open a front-end editor. It&amp;#8217;s time WordPress.com step up its game and stop forcing users through a backend interface to edit published content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the experimental action bar but at the same time, I question the reasoning for adding yet another user interface element to mimic actions already supported by other buttons and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, between the admin bar, dashboard, the edit link underneath a post, and the action bar, there are now four different ways to edit a post. How many roads are necessary to reach the same destination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com, let me know what you think of the action bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.3.3 Patches Security Vulnerabilities in BuddyPress Messages Component</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47948</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-3-patches-security-vulnerabilities-in-buddypress-messages-component</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-41978&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=828%2C265&quot; alt=&quot;BuddyPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3&lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2015/08/buddypress-2-3-3/&quot;&gt; is available&lt;/a&gt; and users are encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;update as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. A few security vulnerabilities were discovered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/buddypress-components-and-features/#internal-messaging&quot;&gt;BuddyPress Messages, &lt;/a&gt;a core component that allows users to send and receive private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to the BuddyPress team that could allow members to manipulate a failed private outbound message and inject unexpected output to the browser. The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof Katowicz-Kowalewski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the first vulnerability, the BuddyPress core development team independently discovered and fixed related vulnerabilities with the messages component that could allow for carefully crafted private message content to be rendered incorrectly to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3 also fixes a couple of bugs in the 2.3 codebase and improves support for backend changes made in WordPress 4.3. To protect your sites from these vulnerabilities, you should perform a full backup and &lt;strong&gt;update BuddyPress as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Theme Review Team Begins Phasing Out Favicon Support</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47940</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-begins-phasing-out-favicon-support</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main features in WordPress 4.3 are Site Icons. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icon&lt;/a&gt; is an image that represents a website across multiple platforms and replaces Favicons. With Site Icons in WordPress core, the WordPress Theme Review team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;phasing out the feature&lt;/a&gt; in existing themes hosted in the theme directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;p&gt;Justin Tadlock, a theme review admin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;published a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to provide a backwards compatible experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tadlock, the easiest method is to check if the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; function exists. This tells you if the user is running WordPress 4.3 and has the site icon feature available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check if the user has set up a new icon using the core WordPress feature by using the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; conditional tag which returns either &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some example code from the tutorial you can use to handle the check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ( ! function_exists( 'has_site_icon' ) || ! has_site_icon() ) {

    // Output old, custom favicon feature.
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional information, I encourage you to read&lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/wordpress/development/backwards-compatibility-site-icons/&quot;&gt; Stephen Cronin&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; which goes into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Theme Review Team enforces a guideline where features added to core are phased out of themes within two major releases. By the time WordPress 4.5 is released, theme authors will be able to remove legacy code without disrupting the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress Community Summit Set for December 2-3, 2015</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47930</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-summit-set-for-december-2-3-2015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/08/26/2015-wordpress-community-summit-dates-announced/&quot;&gt;WordPress community summit&lt;/a&gt; will take place on December 2-3, 2015, in Philadelphia, PA two days before WordCamp US. The summit&amp;nbsp;will be held at &lt;a href=&quot;http://philadelphia.impacthub.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Impact Hub Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, a co-working space where freelancers, entrepreneurs, and social innovators work together, share ideas, and build networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ImpactHub.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47931&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ImpactHub.jpg?resize=500%2C333&quot; alt=&quot;inside Impact Hub&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Inside Impact HubImpact Hub is spacious and has dedicated meeting and conference rooms. According to the announcement, the summit is invite only similar to last year’s event at WordCamp San Francisco:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WordPress Community Summit is a smaller, invite-only event for&amp;nbsp;active members and contributors on the many teams that work to improve&amp;nbsp;WordPress: Core, Design, Mobile, Accessibility, Support, Polygots, Documentation, Themes, Plugins, Community, Meta, Training, Flow&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;TV .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey or application form will soon be published which will result in a pool from which the attendees will be invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit is a rare opportunity for members of various contributor teams to focus and work together in the same physical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual WordPress Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use, build, or make a living with WordPress, please take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2015&quot;&gt;annual survey&lt;/a&gt;. Results will be shared during Matt Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation at WordCamp US. The more people who fill out the survey, the more representative the data will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation from 2014 to see results from the previous survey.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Stream Is Shutting Down Its Cloud Data Storage October 1st</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47925</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/stream-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-data-storage-october-1st</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/introducing-stream-3/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt; and includes some significant improvements. Stream is a WordPress plugin that tracks changes to a site similar to an audit trail. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service&quot;&gt;version two was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, it morphed from a plugin to a service. Activity logs were stored in the cloud which lessened the amount of resources used on local webservers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version three will no longer store data in the cloud. Instead, it will store activity logs locally. The cloud service provided by Stream 2 is closing on &lt;strong&gt;October 1st&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives users a little more than a month to migrate data from the cloud to their local webserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cloud is Expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Carbis, lead developer of Stream, says the time frame was chosen based on a number of factors, &amp;#8220;We chose a 6 week migration window as a balance between bleeding cash and doing the right thing by our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s also helpful to remember that the vast majority of our users are on a Free plan, which only includes 12 weeks of storage. We are monitoring the accounts of each of our paid users and I&amp;#8217;m personally making sure that every one of them has migrated,&amp;#8221; Carbis told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move away from the cloud is largely based on cost. The majority of Stream&amp;#8217;s customers signed up to the free plan with a significant lack of interest in the Pro Subscription. Server costs were also higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XWP to The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lack of income from Stream 2 and acquisition talks failing, Carbis was contracted to do outside work leaving Frankie Jarrett the only person working on the project. Stream&amp;#8217;s investor decided to pull the plug on the project at the same time Jarrett decided to resign from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I heard that Frankie had resigned I gave him a call. We reminisced on our achievements, and threw around some of our ideas on what could have been. That conversation renewed my inspiration. I jotted down some notes, and that’s when things started to turn around,&amp;#8221; Carbis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members from &lt;a href=&quot;https://xwp.co/&quot;&gt;XWP&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to lend a helping hand and the project is now officially under the XWP umbrella. This allows Stream to remain free and open source. The partnership will also facilitate add-on, connectors, and adapters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New in Stream 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is rewritten from the ground up. Activity logs use half the space in the database compared to Stream 2. It supports multisite through the use of Network Admin and uses a dependency injection model to be more extendable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Stream 3 includes a variety of improvements two notable features have been removed, Notifications and Reports. If you depend on these features, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/stream-3-faq/&quot;&gt;review the following FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbis and XWP are taking Stream into a new direction. Stream&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wp-stream/roadmap/&quot;&gt;proposed roadmap&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub and Carbis encourages users to not only review it, but to contribute to the project&amp;#8217;s future, &amp;#8220;I’d like to see Stream’s users contribute more to its direction. Contribution isn’t limited to ideas either. If you can design, develop, or translate, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wp-stream/stream&quot;&gt;contributing to the Stream project&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if Stream can regain the momentum it lost after transitioning to a cloud based system to store data. Now that Stream stores activity logs locally again, those in the EU should be able to use it without breaking privacy laws. Stream is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; on the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Akismet: Quantifying Reddit Bigotry</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1859</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/08/27/quantifying-reddit-bigotry/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2015-08-30): It looks like the team who created the tool decided to retire it due to some reported accuracy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never pass on the opportunity to mix in a little bit of humor with our passion for web content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our engineers, Dan Walmsley, participated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedyhackday.org/la-2015&quot;&gt;Cultivated Wit&amp;#8217;s Comedy Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles last weekend, and his team&amp;#8217;s resulting project has since surfaced on &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-tool-quantifies-reddit-bigotry&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/26/reddit-bigotry-check/&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeredditcheck.com/&quot;&gt;Free Reddit Check&lt;/a&gt;, created by Dan&amp;#8217;s team and crowned with the day&amp;#8217;s top prize, is a site which attempts to quantify the terribleness of Reddit users based on their public comment content and subreddit participation. While perfectly suited for a hack day which pairs developers and comedians, there is certainly usefulness in determining the respectability of a potential online acquaintance. Or just knowing who to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being obsessed with content analysis, community moderation, and keeping the web&amp;#8217;s underbelly in check, we can&amp;#8217;t help but think it&amp;#8217;s a nifty idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1859&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: First Look at the Twenty Sixteen Default WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47897</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.4 is the last scheduled major release of the year and with it will come a new default theme to replace Twenty Fifteen. On the Make WordPress Core site, Tammie Lister &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/25/introducing-twenty-sixteen/&quot;&gt;published an image gallery&lt;/a&gt; that shows off the design of Twenty Sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lister, the process of determining the new default theme has taken months, &amp;#8220;Lots of themes were considered, eventually settling on the one you see below. It’s a perfect fit,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47898&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png?resize=433%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen
&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen is designed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi&quot;&gt;Takashi Irie,&lt;/a&gt; who also designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2013/12/13/twenty-fourteen-wordpress-3-8-parker/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fourteen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2015/03/19/twenty-fifteen-the-wordpress-default-theme-for-2015/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; default themes. Irie describes Twenty Sixteen as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modernized approach of an ever-popular layout — a horizontal masthead and an optional right sidebar that works well with both blogs and websites. It has custom color options that allow you to make your own Twenty Sixteen. The theme was designed on a harmonious fluid grid with a mobile first approach. This means it looks great on any device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theme has hints of Twenty Fourteen but is different enough to stand on its own as a unique design. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look as modern as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; out-of-the box but the design could change during the 4.4 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help Twenty Sixteen be the best it can be, please join the weekly meetings held every Monday and Friday at 16:00 UTC in the #core-themes channel on &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt;. The meetings are a half hour-long and start once the theme is initially added to WordPress core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think of Twenty Sixteen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-40653&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg?resize=628%2C290&quot; alt=&quot;pods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/&quot;&gt;OSTraining&lt;/a&gt;, a site that offers video training for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and other technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/blog/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;http://pods.io/&quot;&gt;Pods Framework&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;training series&lt;/a&gt; is now available for free. Steve Burge, founder of OSTraining.com, says offering the video series for free is the result of a partnership with the Pods Framework project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This project came about because the OSTraining and Pods teams bumped into each other on a regular basis. I often ran into Jim True and Josh Pollock from Pods. We met at WordCamps and WordPress meetups in Tampa, Orlando, and Miami, FL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Pods team explained that they were working on improving their documentation. They started a YouTube series, wrote tutorials, and started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/pods-lead-developer-scott-kingsley-clark-launches-friends-of-pods-funding-campaign&quot;&gt;Friends of Pods&lt;/a&gt; initiative to support their efforts. Making the videos free is our way of contributing to the Pods project,&amp;#8221; Burge told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burge recorded the series after using Pods to create the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appalachiantrail.com/&quot;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt; website. The series provides an introduction to Pods, templates, creating a custom taxonomy, and more. Those interested can view the series on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;OSTraining.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk9dCVMQRmSptuJ6YdVzMkr5&amp;v=4rm95kNxRXg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a look at the first video in the series which introduces viewers to the Pods Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was created in 2014, the series contains great insight into the project and provides an educational foundation for learning Pods 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Request: Alex King Rememberances</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=22017</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear WordPress community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apologies for the selfish and personal nature of this post. I hope you will forgive me given the circumstances. As most of you know, I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as &amp;#8220;dad&amp;#8221;, but when she gets older she&amp;#8217;ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent more than a decade in the WordPress community and I&amp;#8217;d like to request that you to share a few thoughts or remembrances about me that we can compile and share with her when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have crossed paths or if I have managed to do something that you found helpful, I&amp;#8217;d love it if you would take a few minutes to write it down and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/contact&quot;&gt;send it to me&lt;/a&gt; or my wife: heatherkingcom@gmail.com. If you&amp;#8217;re willing to have the story shared publicly, please indicate that accordingly. By default, we will keep everything confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the thread: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; an ongoing story on this site. View the thread timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Step Up Your Game: How to Work With Successful WordPress Clients</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47868</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/step-up-your-game-how-to-work-with-successful-wordpress-clients</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47869&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Mario Y. Peshev&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Ryan Hellyer&quot; href=&quot;http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mario Peshev&lt;/a&gt;. Mario is the founder and WordPress Architect at &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/p9TnMSFMi2&quot;&gt;DevriX&lt;/a&gt; building and maintaining large WordPress-driven platforms. With over 10,000 hours of consulting and training, Mario&amp;#8217;s Yin and Yang is his Open Source advocacy and business growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning &amp;#8211; Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47879&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png?resize=682%2C281&quot; alt=&quot;Step up your game featured image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58522126@N00/430932479&quot;&gt;Stairwell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a learnaholic for as long as I can remember and when I read the aforementioned quote, it resonates strongly with me. My prelude to WordPress years ago was one of the steps toward improvement and success and I’ve developed a special love-hate relationship with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utmost admiration about its influence over the world in terms of Open Source and opportunities for various people in different niches, and its plague of being diminished and depreciated by professional developers and successful businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to solve these issues as long as the inner circle works towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are happy building lego type websites with random ThemeForest themes and you see that as your future, this post is not for you. If you love doing the same repeatedly for mom and pop shops, this may not resonate with you. This is applicable to people who want to get better at what they do, be more professional, and make some impact by solving complex problems for larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress For a Better Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, I presented at a conference focused on kids and teenagers to motivate them, prepare them for the adult life, and nurture their creativity. Kids these days hardly think about their future, between their teenage emotional dramas and boring homework assignments. If you think about it, how can they be passionate about becoming someone if they have no real idea what they need to know and do on a daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used WordPress as an example of a platform that children can use, one that provides them with the opportunity to develop a talent or passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using WordPress for homework and general notes (or a diary) could indicate interest in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young bloggers can potentially do creative writing or copywriting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly switching themes and playing with colors might open the room to design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding plugins and trying to implement complex combinations is the first step to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing posts, looking at analytics and comparing different titles or photos is the way to marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other potential areas of course, but as long as kids can associate with an activity, become passionate about it, and start digging into it, they can save years of slacking, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars on college degrees for specialties they couldn’t care less about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why more and more people join the WordPress industry and switch boring jobs in order to make a living off of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Types Of WordPress Services Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of opportunities for WordPress work is incredible but the vast pool of WordPress jobs is so vague and blurry, that hiring and educating talent is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep an eye on dozens of job boards, portals, and freelance networks. Clients look for Virtual Assistants to get their websites built. They look for expert WordPress developers to apply content changes to their site or web designers to develop complex plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis I see references to WordPress administrators, programmers, developers, designers, marketers, digital artists, webmasters, VAs, and plenty of other job titles used improperly. As a matter of fact, I’m now fascinated when I see a WordPress related job post or an offer looking for the right type of candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news is that you can do anything with WordPress. The caveat here is that WordPress itself is not a skill. You don’t ask for an Internet expert nowadays and you don’t go to the same doctor when you have a headache or you’ve injured your leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide industry of innocent clients and amateur service providers have made it nearly impossible to tell a developer from a marketer, or from a general user who has installed WordPress with an auto-installer twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Indecent World of WordPress Experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-39089&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Job Titles Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/5565517971&quot;&gt;I love &amp;#8217;84&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a lot about impostor syndrome in several reputable WordPress blogs, and people keep identifying themselves in the comments. In my opinion, this is a problem so insignificant as compared to the ever-growing pool of people claiming to be WordPress Experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last several years, I’ve interacted with people all around the world working with WordPress. From freelancers to successful business owners at conferences, and from beginner virtual assistants to full-stack consultants in social media, blogs and job networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of service providers that I’ve found is the one of &lt;em&gt;WordPress experts&lt;/em&gt;. You can easily substitute expert with specialist, guru, master, ninja and rockstar. Just open a new tab and do a few quick searches in Google, job networks, social media and view the large number of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list are &lt;em&gt;WordPress developers&lt;/em&gt;. A WordPress developer is often described as people who install plugins. There are various possible scenarios, but this is rarely the definition of an actual developer proficient in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some boards or blogs list specific skills that let you filter by programming language or a separate tool. My latest research with 200 contractors with WordPress developer titles led to 170 people who rate themselves with 4 or 5 out of 5 stars in PHP proficiency, and 30 with 3 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 170 people in the first group, 150 were college students, Internet marketers, VAs, and people who have substituted strings in WordPress themes thanks to support forums or help from the Codex. Not a single line of code was written from scratch, let alone building anything, and 4 out of 5 or higher self-assessed their level of PHP experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom McFarlin &lt;a href=&quot;http://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-developers-programmer-implementer/&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the difference between a developer and implementer and I wrote an overview defining &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-job-titles-dont-mean-much-anymore&quot;&gt;various technical skills in the WordPress context&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the lack of proper training, any official educational resource or meaningful set of skills per role, both finding talent and improving one’s skills is being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge you to interview several successful clients around you who looked for skillful WordPress folks. They either happened to know the right people, were recommended someone, ended up with several freelancers who messed up big time, went AWOL and suddenly took the cash and disappeared, couldn’t deliver, or they did and the site is incredibly slow and/or got hacked soon thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s sending serious businesses away and I won’t touch the topic of under pricing services and products which brings the quality and support way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivates people to use a reliable resource in order to grow? The WordPress Foundation, nor any of the big players provide official training curriculum, and a definition for formal roles. There is no WordPress certification program (I won’t get into that to avoid unnecessary discussions), and there are no clear paths for requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WordPress Community is Filled with Amateurs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, our community is a large group mostly composed of amateurs who started using WordPress one way or another. These people started earning money and reached a point where they don’t know where they stand, what they’re proficient in, if they’re doing fine, whether they’re experts, impostors, or somewhere in the middle, and what would be helpful to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still use FTP and work with PHP 5.2-supported hosts. The most popular theme marketplaces provide products with broken and inconsistent code. The WordPress.org plugin repository accepts plenty of plugins with suspicious consistency and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these issues are recognized publicly in the WordPress community. Some hosts prohibit SSH and allow solely FTP. PHP 5.2 will be supported by Core for a while, which doesn’t motivate hosts to upgrade. Marketplaces earn millions from their top sellers, so they’re not interested in quickly bringing up quality as long as poorly coded themes sell well. There’s also no formal constantly reviewed plugin repository for high quality plugins and no one is actively backing this idea up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the last paragraph as a rant, it’s because it is. It’s meant to be a “wake up call” to clients who don’t know better and service providers who want to become better. While the WordPress Core itself is incredibly stable and flexible, the rest of the infrastructure is mostly poorly coded due to under pricing, lack of skills, and lack of more successful clients interested in backing up WordPress teams and consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of people and plenty of applications of WordPress. Whatever you do, it’s your professional duty to offer the right type of service instead of misleading your clients, and be aware of the other pertinent verticals. Moreover, it’s the only way forward working with reputable organizations and large profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a Successful Client?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-32204&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png?resize=636%2C278&quot; alt=&quot;Success Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeveeaar/2035597695/&quot;&gt;seeveeaar&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige Conference&lt;/a&gt; happened a few weeks ago, and Shane Pearlman from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tri.be/&quot;&gt;Modern Tribe&lt;/a&gt; shared his experience in a presentation entitled, Land the Big Fish: Strategies Acquiring Larger Clients. It’s a motivational talk that outlines different strategies on negotiating and landing larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the session, Pearlman is asked, “What’s in it for me to go through all of that headache to procure bigger brand names?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated at the beginning, working with successful clients is not for everyone. Some people are afraid to leave their comfort zone. Others are too lazy to learn new skills or sometimes doing the same thing repeatedly may be their perfect job. For every other entrepreneur or business player, successful clients are exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each small change is magnified when working with successful clients. Usually, they have a lot of employees, a solid budget for marketing and advertising, a lot of traffic, and various complex requirements that help them attract more leads or automate their processes. T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hey are often respectable and have access to more capital. This allows them to invest more since their return of investment is worth it; while taking a risk due to saving a few bucks could very well ruin their reputation and harm their business. There are several examples of products or companies in the WordPress community that were hacked or where updates caused major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with successful clients is extremely rewarding and exciting, but getting there requires ace skills and solid experience, as well as the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Target Successful Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience with banks, telecoms, automotive, airline brands, large educational institutions and media outlets over the last 12 years as a developer and a technical lead, there are several specific areas where courageous WordPress freelancers and small business owners can focus on if they are aiming for growth and successful clients, but aren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have identified some steps for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/08/8-steps-to-move-from-freelancer-to-successful-company/&quot;&gt;moving from a freelancer to a successful company&lt;/a&gt;. Here is what we should focus on in the WordPress context in order to step up our game, understand our industry better, and start acting professionally if we want to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress is a Vague Term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a WordPress Expert says nothing. You may be a lead developer of WordPress or someone who can memorize the order of all submenus under Settings in the admin dashboard. Both are classified as WordPress experts and that’s what many people don’t realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialize in a given niche and polish your skills. Focus on a specific group of projects &amp;#8211; membership websites, eCommerce stores, multisite installs. Become a know-it-all professional for an extensible plugin such as, BuddyPress, Gravity Forms, or Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the value you are providing and what it corresponds to. Be respectful to the broad community of professionals in your area, learn from them, ask them to be your mentors. Even the best athletes and CEOs have coaches, business mentors, and boards of directors. Find out what it is that you do whether it’s design, development, marketing, or something else and learn the skill inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Installments Don’t Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people offer WordPress services as an add-on to their portfolio of other services without realizing the impact it has on the business. While WordPress is used for plenty of purposes, it’s still a technical platform that comes with its own specific set of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what will happen if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a vulnerable plugin that is exploited and your client’s password is stolen, along with their private details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You forget to protect the media uploader and the client uploads sensitive data. Scanned images of contracts and ID cards end up in the public space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your sitemap plugin indexes protected data since you used a plugin that doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a site and sell it to a client, and due to the terrible choice of plugins, the site crashes miserably and kills the server during a demonstration in front of their big clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a small list of what ifs, but they happen all the time. If you don’t possess the skills or offer the wrong service, this could damage your client’s business. Upping your game and providing solutions instead of websites allows you to take care of the infrastructure, maintenance work, support, development, security, marketing of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, be aware of the consequences and partner up with other agencies and consultants. Complete packages are what successful clients look for and inexperienced people often mess up what others have built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Expert Skills Won’t Cut It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients look for professional skills. They have real problems that can’t be solved with yet another plugin, and they are smart enough to know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the business of configuring themes and installing a few plugins for clients, that won’t do it for successful customers. You need to specialize in code, design, user experience, marketing, or something else that brings real value to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large clients are looking for state of the art designs, performant and secure code, brilliant marketing skills, and growth hacking strategy. Large clients are successful because they are outstanding at what they do, the services they offer, and they appreciate high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context-Specific WordPress Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations take their marketing presence and technical stack seriously. They carefully delegate based on multiple factors. Being in a meeting with a large client typically means discussing a use case together with several people such as, a creative director, VP of marketing, network engineer, and project manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being skillful in your niche and ready to provide value, you have to learn the business processes of your target client. Your idea of a solution may be applicable for small sites, but it may very well be a bad fit based on the company policy or the variety of services used by the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, a creative director may require you to prepare your theme to be ADA Section 508 compliant, which is an accessibility standard required by certain organizations. The VP of marketing may ask for a Hubspot integration with Cvent within your website for proper CRM and meeting request management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network engineer could outline that they need to host the solution on-site, and set up a specific set of web application firewalls and internal web server security rules restricting certain process callbacks. The project manager might share a complicated timeline based on the organization load, holiday schedule, decision maker’s availability, conferences, and various deliverables that need to be presented by different people and other third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are things that we’ve been asked for over the past few months. If you are used to working with a specific host using Apache, prepare for writing documentation and shipping to a restricted server running HHVM. If you use a framework that isn’t accessible, you will need to step back, explore the Section 508 standards, and build something compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic solutions are often not the right fit for large clients. But if you’re determined to learn more and become a better professional, that’s the perfect challenge for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solving More Complex Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to adjust to different environments, working with large clients means solving more complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a mom and pop shop is somewhat broken or down, it’s probably not a big deal if their site receives 100 visits per month. But for a project with tens of millions of views a month and thousands of concurrent users, it is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on larger and heavy platforms often means dealing with a lot of data, complex relationships, and solid traffic. This means that every single line of your code and business decision will inevitably impact the entire system in a way visible to hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to cope with these, you should study your specialty in detail and understand what the impact is of every single change. These skills increase your value and let you face similar challenges and solve problems that the majority of beginners can’t even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn a lot about the entire stack, and get to know hundreds of different rules. At some point you will voluntarily violate those rules, being aware of the fact that some design patterns and best practices don’t solve specific problems. It’s better to denormalize a database or minify a compression algorithm in order to solve a business problem for a large platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just as they say at a music college &amp;#8211; you learn the music theory for three years, and then you throw everything away and start playing jazz. You need to know the entire architecture and strategy first in order to decide how to optimize it in the best possible manner, whether it’s using a best practice or violating one for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaming Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have worked solo or in a small team, you will eventually need to partner up or grow. Either way, large projects are time consuming and require different expertise, and it’s unthinkable for one to know it all. Therefore, you will work with other professionals from more industries, team up and solve more complex problems together, and learn more about their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have thought about mastering a single skill, teaming up with the right people will add a few more skills as an extra perk, which will increase the potential of your main skill as well. Working with financial analysts on a project for a bank helped me to understand the entire model of loans and mortgages, as well as the internal banking policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to learn how loans and interests work in different cases and get acquainted with standardized security regulations at companies in the financial field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-44224&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png?resize=688%2C368&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Security Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/8264582@N06/3383392046&quot;&gt;Two Locks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy and security are important topics that people often misjudge. Working with large clients means more responsibility and higher impact in case of a problem. In the process of building a solution or consulting a reputable organization, you will most likely have to comply with various security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of them may seem unnecessary, there is a reason they exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better it is for you, your clients, and future endeavors. If you’re not using VPNs, SSH keys, two-factor authentication, or voice recognition IDS, this may be a good lesson for you. Why are they needed, what problems do they solve, and how can you apply them to your personal data and existing set of clients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization and Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47877&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg?resize=620%2C400&quot; alt=&quot;BrainyQuote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BrainyQuote
&lt;p&gt;In order to be helpful to large businesses as a consultant, or an agency, you need to be reliable. This may be a result of a number of testimonials, successful track record at previous companies or a good portfolio. It’s always challenging to start with large customers, so improving your skills and working hard in order to become valuable is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being organized and process-oriented is essential to most reputable organizations. The majority of them are more conservative and operate slowly, since a minor mistake could cost them millions or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rely on detailed specifications, scope of work documents, use case diagrams, UX mockups/wireframes, E/R diagrams, and a large list of documents. They include every single detail in their planning &amp;#8211; from holidays for each member of their team, to different dependencies from other service providers and third-party members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients have managed to build a process and scale it in a way that grows their revenue in a predictable way. In order to be able to handle large projects, you need to treat them as a small project that takes longer to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use a project management system and version control properly, define your pricing strategy, make sure to predict all of the delays for both communication and payments. Learn how large organizations operate and do your due diligence upfront in order to avoid surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take anything for granted and don’t assume anything. The more confident you are, the higher the possibility of making a major mistake. There are always new automatic deployment strategies or a DevOps service you haven’t heard of, another massive CSS3 grid, or a growth hacking strategy that you haven’t explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more challenges you face, the more you’ll learn, and be able to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Personal WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=21662</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/22/personal-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve forked the FavePersonal theme to release a few changes that I&amp;#8217;ve made to it for my own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improved Gallery feature, including support for WordPress shortcode galleries. If you&amp;#8217;re uploading photos directly to your gallery post, you can use drag and drop to set the order for them now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Post Formats admin UI is now responsive and works great on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the Social plugin from the theme (requested by WP.org) &amp;#8211; it can still be installed separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make tons of misc. code changes to match new coding standards vs. previous coding standards (and pass the theme check).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/maine-gallery-510x469.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gallery&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-22028&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally hoping to have the modified theme hosted on WordPress.org but after weeks of waiting for review, they responded that features of the theme like &lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24520#comment:4&quot;&gt;choosing colors and post formats&lt;/a&gt; should be done in separate plugins instead. This makes no sense to me as these are core features of the theme, but happily there are great places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that will host the project for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Personal theme is quite assuredly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?url=alexking.org&quot;&gt;mobile-friendly&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it a great fit for the importance Google&amp;#8217;s is placing on mobile-friendly sites lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub or, for you technically minded, grab the reop with git. Just make sure to also grab the submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:alexkingorg/wp-personal.git&lt;br /&gt;
cd wp-personal&lt;br /&gt;
git submodule update --init --recursive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/project/personal&quot;&gt;Personal Theme&lt;/a&gt;. View the project timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordCampus a Conference Devoted to Using WordPress in Higher Education</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47853</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordcampus-a-conference-devoted-to-using-wordpress-in-higher-education</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Higher education is a subject that &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.tv/?s=education&quot;&gt;some WordCamps&lt;/a&gt; have tackled over the years, but what if there was an event entirely devoted to it? That&amp;#8217;s the idea &lt;a href=&quot;http://bamadesigner.com&quot;&gt;Rachel Carden&lt;/a&gt; is proposing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;. The idea started off as a tweet but quickly gained momentum with others in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ooh. Dream with me: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampus?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;: A WordCamp for folks using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordPress&lt;/a&gt; in Higher Education.&quot; I like it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/heweb?src=hash&quot;&gt;#heweb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&quot;&gt;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rachel Carden (@bamadesigner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/628324358126235648&quot;&gt;August 3, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCampus is an event that would cover topics such as, how to manage a large-scale network of faculty blogs, abiding by FERPA regulations, or how to best implement single sign-on that integrates with Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carden &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-ed-conference-wordcampus/&quot;&gt;outlines her idea in detail&lt;/a&gt; on Post Status and says that even though camp is in the event&amp;#8217;s name, it doesn&amp;#8217;t imply that it would be an official WordCamp event. She&amp;#8217;s also open to organizing an event not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in speaking, sponsoring, or attending WordCampus, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;fill out the survey &lt;/a&gt;and help spread the word. The more interest Carden generates, the more likely it is that the WordPress Foundation will back the event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47850</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/what-do-you-want-to-see-in-wordpress-4-4</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Scott Taylor, who is &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-team-announces-release-leads-for-wordpress-4-3-and-4-4&quot;&gt;leading the development cycle&lt;/a&gt; for WordPress 4.4, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/19/wordpress-4-4-whats-on-your-wishlist/&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the Make WordPress Core site asking people what they&amp;#8217;d like to see in WordPress 4.4. The post has generated a number of comments from the community. Some of the most popular suggestions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REST API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fields API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Term Meta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcake UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31467&quot;&gt;Ticket 31467&lt;/a&gt; Images should default to not linking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RICG Responsive Images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posts 2 Posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the items suggested are at various stages of development and there&amp;#8217;s no guarantee any of them will make it into WordPress 4.4. However, the comments provide insight into what a lot of developers want in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#8217;s a ticket, feature, or plugin you&amp;#8217;d like to see in WordPress 4.4, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/19/wordpress-4-4-whats-on-your-wishlist/&quot;&gt;leave a comment&lt;/a&gt; on the post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress Foundation Begins Accepting Applications for the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship</title>

	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-begins-accepting-applications-for-the-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KimParsell.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-36619&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KimParsell.png?resize=655%2C418&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp San Francisco 2014 By Sheri Bigelow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordCamp San Francisco 2014 By Sheri Bigelow
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the WordPress Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/&quot;&gt;created a scholarship&lt;/a&gt; in memory of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away&quot;&gt;Kim Parsell&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate her life and contributions to WordPress. With the date and location secured for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/philadelphia-pa-to-host-wordcamp-us-december-4th-6th&quot;&gt;WordCamp US&lt;/a&gt;, applications for the scholarship are now &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/kim-parsell-scholarship-application&quot;&gt;being accepted&lt;/a&gt; by the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the scholarship are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a scholarship for a woman contributor with financial need who has never attended WordCamp San Francisco before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will cover the ticket cost, flight, and lodging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will not cover things like taxis, meals outside the official event, or airport transportation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One scholarship is awarded per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is funded by the WordPress Foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application deadline is September 2, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decision will be made by September 16, 2015, and applicants contacted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the nature of this scholarship &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/&quot;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt;, applicants must fulfill four requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A woman (this includes trans women)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An active contributor to the WordPress open source project (through one of the contributor teams or as a local meetup/WordCamp organizer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone with financial need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone who has never attended WordCamp San Francisco (the precursor to WCUS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim was an older woman who encouraged others, especially women around the same age group to get involved with WordPress. In light of this, older women are highly encouraged to apply for the scholarship if you meet the other requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim once told me that attending WordCamp San Francisco 2014 was one of the best experiences of her life. It was her first WordCamp San Francisco and although she was unemployed at the time, she was able to attend thanks to financial assistance received from the &lt;a title=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to Jen Mylo, the WordPress Foundation, and Matt Mullenweg for not only creating the scholarship, but for providing the opportunity for others to potentially have the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Hybrid Core 3.0 Experiments With Community-driven Documentation</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47825</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/hybrid-core-3-0-experiments-with-community-driven-documentation</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Core 3.0, developed by Justin Tadlock, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://themehybrid.com/weblog/hybrid-core-version-3-0-mr-reynolds&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;. More than a year in the making, 3.0 has over 269 commits and a slew of new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the release of Hybrid Core 2.0 last year, Tadlock assumed it would be at least two years before he tackled another major release, &amp;#8220;I’d planned on doing minor and patch releases for a while, all along building themes,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;However, a lot has changed in the theming world in just the past year. WordPress has added a lot of cool features for theme authors that were previously handled by Hybrid Core,&amp;#8221; Tadlock said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadlock wants the project to feel fresh and one way to do that is to remove features that are handled natively by WordPress. Features removed from Hybrid Core include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atomic hooks functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random Custom Background extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Featured Header extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaner Caption extension (handled in WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop title/description (replaced by WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pagination (replaced by WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s clear that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/&quot;&gt;customizer in WordPress is here to stay&lt;/a&gt; and will be an important part of the project&amp;#8217;s future. Hybrid Core 3.0 adds a variety of enhancements that make the customizer more flexible, these include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color Palette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Checkbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropdown Terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio Image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Select.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a few customizer setting classes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array Map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image Data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tadlock Experiments with Community-driven Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the largest changes to the Hybrid project is opening up documentation to be community-driven. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/wiki&quot;&gt;Hybrid Core wiki&lt;/a&gt; hosted on Github is now open to contributions from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadlock believes that this will drive adoption of the framework by more theme authors, &amp;#8220;The more developers we have using and contributing to the project, the better,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the community responds well to the experiment, it will allow Tadlock to focus on longer-form tutorials for club members, something he feels he&amp;#8217;s better at doing than reference style documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Core 3.0 includes a number of features, bug fixes, and improvements. If you want to see all of the changes in 3.0, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/blob/master/changelog.md&quot;&gt;lengthy changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;After four months of development led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://konstantin.obenland.it/&quot;&gt;Konstantin Obenland&lt;/a&gt;, WordPress 4.3 &amp;#8220;Billie&amp;#8221; named after jazz singer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billieholiday.com/&quot;&gt;Billie Holiday&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/billie/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;. This release features menus in the customizer, strong passwords by default, site icons, and variety of other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Menus in the Customizer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now create, add, and edit menus in the customizer while previewing changes to your site in real-time. Unlike other parts of the customizer, previewing menus should be fast as it uses a new hybrid transport layer. Weston Ruter, who contributed to fast previews in the customizer &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/fast-previewing-changes-to-menus-in-the-customizer/&quot;&gt;explains the approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to enable fast previewing of menu changes by default. So we implemented a &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;refresh&lt;/code&gt; hybrid approach which uses &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt; to sync the menus settings to the preview, and then the preview does an Ajax request to render just the contents of the menu container, and this Ajax response is then inserted into the DOM to replace the previous menu container. The technical name for this approach we have been calling &amp;#8216;partial refresh&amp;#8217;, but you can call it fast preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, previewing menus in most themes should be a fast experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/menu-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47806&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/menu-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Menu Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Menu Customizer
&lt;h2&gt;Strong Passwords by Default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Jaquith &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/&quot;&gt;led the effort&lt;/a&gt; to improve the way passwords are chosen and changed in WordPress. On the account management page, clicking the Generate Password button generates a strong password by default. The password strength meter is better integrated into the password field which lets users know immediately when their password is weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/better-passwords.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47807&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/better-passwords.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Better Passwords in WordPress&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Better Passwords in WordPress
&lt;p&gt;The same interface is on the add new user screen, the password reset screen, and the WordPress install screen. While WordPress doesn&amp;#8217;t require users to have a strong password, it does everything it can to encourage users to choose one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, WordPress no longer emails passwords and password reset links expire after 24 hours. When your password or e-mail changes, WordPress sends you an email so if someone hijacks your browser session and changes these items, you’ll be notified that it happened, and you can take action. You can disable these e-mails via the &lt;code&gt;send_pass_change_email&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;send_email_change_email&lt;/code&gt; filters by setting them to false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Icons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icons&lt;/a&gt; are images that represent a website across multiple platforms. You can configure your Site Icon in the Site Identity panel within the customizer where you can upload a 512X512 sized image. This image will be used for browsers, iOS, Android, and Microsoft devices when a visitor bookmarks your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;h2&gt;Text Patterns, Quick Link Toolbar, and Word Count Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editor in WordPress 4.3 has &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/text-patterns-and-the-quick-link-toolbar-in-wordpress-4-3&quot;&gt;undergone more improvements&lt;/a&gt; with text shortcuts, a quick link toolbar, and word count changes. Text patterns or text shortcuts allow you to quickly add unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, and blockquotes without having to use a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When starting a new paragraph with one of these formatting shortcuts followed by a space, the formatting will be applied automatically. Press Backspace or Escape to undo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the visual editor in WordPress 4.3, typing &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and hitting the space bar will generate a bulleted list. Typing &lt;code&gt;1. &lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;1)&lt;/code&gt; and hitting space will generate a numbered list. If you don’t want to create these lists or do so in error, clicking the undo button or hitting &lt;code&gt;ctrl/cmd+z&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt; will undo the text pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a paragraph with two to six number signs &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a heading. Similarly, the greater-than symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;## = H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### = H3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### = H4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;##### = H5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;###### = H6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick Link Preview Toolbar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click a link in the WordPress 4.3 visual editor, a small inline link toolbar displays the full URL with buttons to edit or remove it. This avoids having to use the Insert/edit link modal window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47792&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png?resize=571%2C102&quot; alt=&quot;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3
&lt;p&gt;Word and character counts have also changed in WordPress 4.3. Instead of updating counts when pressing enter or return, it will refresh when you stop typing. A lot more characters that shouldn’t be counted as words are excluded. Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe, WordPress core contributor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/wordcharacter-count-updates-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;lists other notable changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to the Admin Bar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 moves the Customize link to the top-level menu of the admin bar. This link opens the customizer, allowing you to manage menus, appearance, and widgets through the customizer interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46995 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png?resize=429%2C232&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46996 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png?resize=428%2C202&quot; alt=&quot;WP43AdminBar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Admin Bar
&lt;p&gt;The Dashboard, Themes, Widgets, and Menus links take users to their corresponding admin pages in the backend of WordPress. This makes it clear which interface users are about to enter. The enhancement is a result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32678&quot;&gt;ticket #32678&lt;/a&gt; where Helen Hou-Sandí and other WordPress core contributors discussed ways to improve the context of each link over the course of five weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Noteworthy Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-improves-user-search-and-turns-comments-off-on-pages-by-default&quot;&gt;Comments are turned off on pages by default&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Singular.php was added to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/06/singular-php-new-theme-template-in-wordpress-4-3/&quot;&gt;WordPress template hierarchy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/31/headings-in-admin-screens-change-in-wordpress-4-3/&quot;&gt;Header tags were updated through the admin screens&lt;/a&gt;. Plugin, theme, and framework developers, please change the main heading from an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; into an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Also, check the rest of your heading structure to ensure it’s semantic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/24/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;Multisite focused changes in 4.3&lt;/a&gt; specifically, the introduction of get_main_network_id()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/30/get_transient-is-now-more-strict-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;get_transient() is now more strict in 4.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/old-distraction-free-writing-code-removed-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;Distraction Free Writing (DFW) code has been removed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code that powered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/30/legacy-theme-preview-removed-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;old theme preview has been removed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/08/list-table-changes-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;List tables have undergone API and UI changes&lt;/a&gt;, with the introduction of a primary column concept and easier subclassing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 is the result of hundreds of paid and non-paid volunteers working tirelessly to improve the software used on more than 24% of the web. If you experience any issues with WordPress 4.3, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;report them on the support forums&lt;/a&gt;. Volunteers are watching support threads closely and if warranted, will create a thread listing known issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enjoy the full upgrade experience, I encourage you to listen to Lady sings The Blues by Billie Holiday as you upgrade your WordPress sites.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Do you know someone who is an amazing developer or designer? Someone who is passionate about helping people? An awesome lounge manager? Or maybe that person is you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://automattic.com/work-with-us/&quot;&gt;Automattic is hiring for a variety of positions&lt;/a&gt;, and for all except two you can live and work wherever you like in the entire planet. There are also a number of other benefits; the main downside it&amp;#8217;s a high performance culture and expectations are extremely high. Automattic hires the best folks regardless of geography, and we are &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; looking for people right now outside of US timezones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Text Patterns and the Quick Link Toolbar in WordPress 4.3</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47790</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/text-patterns-and-the-quick-link-toolbar-in-wordpress-4-3</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/QuickLinkToolbarFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47794&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/QuickLinkToolbarFeaturedImage.png?resize=675%2C209&quot; alt=&quot;Quick Link Toolbar Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/34547181@N00/4309431757&quot;&gt;metal chain&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 is on schedule to be released &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-3-project-schedule/&quot;&gt;August 18th&lt;/a&gt; and contains a number of improvements. Among the enhancements to the visual editor are text patterns. Text patterns or text shortcuts allow you to quickly add unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, and blockquotes without having to use a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the visual editor in WordPress 4.3, typing &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and hitting the space bar will generate a bulleted list. Typing &lt;code&gt;1. &lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;1)&lt;/code&gt; and hitting space will generate a numbered list. If you don&amp;#8217;t want to create these lists or do so in error, clicking the undo button or hitting &lt;code&gt;ctrl/cmd+z&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt; will undo the text pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a paragraph with two to six number signs &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a heading. Similarly, the greater-than symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;## = H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### = H3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### = H4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;##### = H5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;###### = H6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a few tries to figure out but once I got the hang of it, I discovered that I prefer using text patterns versus clicking the appropriate button in the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the blockquote text pattern places text into a blockquote and automatically closes it while also starting a new paragraph. Traditionally, I highlight text and click on the blockquote button in the editor. Often times, I have to visit the text editor and close the blockquote to start a new paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Boren, WordPress core lead developer, created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/01/editor-enhancements-in-4-3-%E2%9C%A8/&quot;&gt;following video&lt;/a&gt; which shows the text patterns in action on a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Previews of Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.2 included a subtle but convenient feature for adding links to text. Pasting the URL to highlighted text automatically turns it into a link. The problem is that there isn&amp;#8217;t an easy way to preview the URL without opening it in a new browser tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click a link in the WordPress 4.3 visual editor, a small inline link toolbar displays the full URL with buttons to edit or remove it. This avoids having to use the Insert/edit link modal window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47792&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png?resize=571%2C102&quot; alt=&quot;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preview Links in The WordPress 4.3 Visual Editor
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to Word and Character Counts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word and character counts have also changed in WordPress 4.3. Instead of updating counts when pressing enter or return, it will refresh when you stop typing. A lot more characters that shouldn&amp;#8217;t be counted as words are excluded. Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe, WordPress core contributor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/wordcharacter-count-updates-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;lists other notable changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;character&lt;/strong&gt; count, we no longer exclude any of these characters. This means that numbers and common western punctuation are no longer excluded compared to 4.2. Emoji and other astral characters are now counted as one character instead of two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a new type &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt;, in addition to words and characters, that will count characters including spaces. This seemed necessary for Japanese and maybe other languages. This is now &lt;code&gt;character_including_spaces&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;character_excluding_spaces&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcodes and HTML comments are now excluded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view details and a summary of all the work that went into improving word counts, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30966&quot;&gt;ticket #30966&lt;/a&gt; on trac. As someone who uses the WordPress content editor for a living, I&amp;#8217;m anxiously looking forward to utilizing these enhancements on an everyday basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: A WordPress conference for higher education: coming to a campus near you?</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14001</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-ed-conference-wordcampus/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Thus far, there have been numerous niche WordPress conferences aiming toward for-profit initiatives and geared toward businesses, marketers, or eCommerce site owners. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://bamadesigner.com/&quot;&gt;Rachel Carden&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s concept for a niche, education focused, non-profit event is unique and I&amp;#8217;d love to see it happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As she notes, universities have unique challenges for managing websites and are also great candidates for utilizing WordPress to its full potential. What follows is her pitch and public brainstorming session on what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org/&quot;&gt;higher education focused WordPress conference&lt;/a&gt; might look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started with a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ooh. Dream with me: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampus?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;: A WordCamp for folks using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordPress&lt;/a&gt; in Higher Education.&quot; I like it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/heweb?src=hash&quot;&gt;#heweb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&quot;&gt;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rachel Carden (@bamadesigner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/628324358126235648&quot;&gt;August 3, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCamp U.S. made a big announcement that was all over Twitter, Chris Lema tweeted what we were all thinking, and I couldn’t help but start daydreaming about the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I’m a web designer and developer with a passion for all things WordPress, especially using WordPress to build the world of higher ed web. Having spent the last 8 years working in higher education, I’m always looking for ways to utilize the power of WordPress to fulfill my campus’s needs and to help its communication grow, whether it’s using the powerful CMS to stretch limited resources or using its new API capabilities to share information, and break down silos, across campus departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love attending WordCamps and other WordPress-related events, but the issues we generally encounter in higher ed are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like online businesses or blogging, higher ed is a world of its own with unique challenges, content, stakeholders, and target audiences. In our world, we don’t worry so much about which eCommerce plugin is best. Instead, we’re more concerned with things like how to manage a large-scale network of faculty blogs, making sure we’re abiding with FERPA regulations, or wondering how to best implement single sign-on that integrates with Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m proposing a new event in the WordPress community: a conference focused on using WordPress in the world of higher education. I call the idea “WordCampus”. (Kind of a perfect name, right? How did nobody think of this before?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name “WordCampus” came to me from a tweet and does not, at this point, imply it would be an official WordCamp event. If needed, I’m open to organizing an event that is not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation. This is a detail that remains to be seen, but honestly, at this point, all details remain to be seen. A WordCamp representative has confirmed that a user group specific WordCamp is possible, but I would need to prove that it could draw a crowd. That’s why I need your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a WordPress conference for higher ed is something you would be interested in (whether it’s as an attendee, speaker, planner, sponsor, or all of the above), I invite you to read a few of my thoughts, share yours in the comments, and visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org/&quot;&gt;wordcampus.org&lt;/a&gt; to show your support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cost and fee consideration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like your usual WordCamp, the goal for this event is to keep the costs and ticket price as low as possible. The point of this event is professional development and community, not profit. The phrases “big budget” and “higher ed” don’t generally appear in the same sentence anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of higher ed-oriented web conferences can run upwards of $500 so an inexpensive, but valuable, event would be attractive for most higher education web professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unique sponsorship opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having sponsors to help with costs would be crucial and I am open to all kinds of support, whether it’s monetary or in-kind. Sponsoring an event like WordCampus would be a unique way to get an organization’s name in front of one of the best communities &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of WordPress that &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; WordPress all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of higher education, you often have limited resources, so there are plenty of opportunities for third party products or services like hosting, themes, plugins, custom design, accessibility consulting, and custom development, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Location is a factor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location could be a sticking point, as high travel costs might be a deal breaker for many WordCampus attendees. The beauty of local WordCamps is that they are tied to a geographical region and therefore, for most attendees, have limited travel requirements. This could be a problem for an event that is not tied to a specific region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue wise, universities have beautiful facilities, so I’d love to host the event on an actual college campus and, if the hosting university could donate the space in kind, this would be a huge cost saver. The most preferable universities would also be located near a major airport to help reduce travel time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m really dreaming big, it would be great to find numerous universities that would be willing to host and, therefore, we could have regional WordCampus events spread across the country. I don’t think this is outside the realm of possibility, but would depend on interest and attendance. I&amp;#8217;m certainly interested in hearing from anyone that may be interested in hosting WordCampus at their university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A big target audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a wide variety of WordPress users in higher ed, from the university-level WordPress developers and administrators, to the users who run WordPress for a college, to the faculty members using WordPress as a learning tool, and any students who’d love to learn a thing or two (they are our future, you know). That’s not even including content strategists, designers, social media managers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCampus has the potential to attract a variety of users who could inspire a multitude of topics and professional development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A broad variety of topics, even within the education umbrella&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of topics, these could also run the gamut from higher ed marketing and content strategy to infrastructure, managing multi-author blogs, and streamlining application processes. Accessibility should also be a featured topic as federally funded institutions are required by law to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I see the structure of higher ed as tailor-made for the open source mindset and would love to hear someone encourage collaboration and openness by comparing the ideologies of open source with the inner workings of higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Event timing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As organizing something of this magnitude takes time, I’m looking at a 2016 booking. What time of the year in 2016, however, remains to be seen. There are obviously a lot of variables at play, from venue availability to which time of the year is best for our target attendees. In higher ed, you need time to clear your schedule and request funding, so I’d want to allow for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the middle of the semester is best for most higher ed professionals, but this can vary depending on their field. And if we’re being honest, the majority of fall might be out of the question because of football season. We’ve included a straw poll &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org&quot;&gt;on the event landing page&lt;/a&gt; to help us gauge which time of year might be best for those interested in attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read through my proposal and hopefully interested parties will have a few additional thoughts for the comments. If you would like be notified of any future developments, or show your support for the project, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org&quot;&gt;wordcampus.org&lt;/a&gt; to share a little bit of information. And don’t forget to tell your friends!&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I had great BBQ in San Francisco last week at a new place called Smokestack. The brisket was on-point, and competitive with anything I&amp;#8217;ve had in Texas. &lt;a href=&quot;http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2014/05/08/magnolia-opens-dogpatch-brewery-and-its-restaurant-smokestack/#photo-451076&quot;&gt;This review in the SF Chronicle covers things pretty well&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;#8217;re hankering for some great Southern food in SF this is the place to check out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WP REST API 1.2.3 Patches XSS Vulnerability</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47770</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-1-2-3-patches-xss-vulnerability</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WP REST API version 1.2.3 and 2.0 Beta 4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/14/rest-api-v1-2-3-and-v2-0-b4/&quot;&gt;address a security issue&lt;/a&gt; that affects sites running 1.2 or 2.0 beta. This release fixes a potential XSS vulnerability related to JSONP support in 1.2 and 2.0 of the API. Automatic updates are in progress for 1.2.3 but if your site hasn&amp;#8217;t automatically updated, the team suggests updating manually as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the security release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/&quot;&gt;2.0 Beta 4&lt;/a&gt; includes a number of enhancements, some of which break backwards compatibility. Developers and beta testers should read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/releases/tag/2.0-beta4&quot;&gt;detailed changelog&lt;/a&gt; and release notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Nick Haskins Rebrands Lasso to Editus</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47763</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/nick-haskins-rebrands-lasso-to-editus</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In mid July, Nick Haskins, founder and lead developer of Lasso, was served a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/nick-haskins-receives-cease-and-desist-letter-for-violating-lassosoft-trademarks&quot;&gt;cease and desist letter&lt;/a&gt; from LassoSoft. LassoSoft argued that Lasso violates its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=861046116&quot;&gt;registered trademarks&lt;/a&gt; and causes confusion to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EdiusFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-47764&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EdiusFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C182&quot; alt=&quot;Edit us Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Instead of fighting litigation, Haskins decided to rebrand the product from Lasso to&lt;a href=&quot;https://edituswp.com/lasso-is-now-editus/&quot;&gt; Editus.&lt;/a&gt; The name was suggested by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iklektive.com/&quot;&gt;Gavin Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;. According to Haskins, the only references to the name is a band in Costa Rica and a directory in Luxemburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a new domain and cloned website, Lasso 0.9.8 is available for download which includes the renaming of various admin menu items that used the term Lasso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lasso 0.9.8 Requires a Manual Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haskins says users will need to update to 0.9.8 manually because of the switch in domain names but automatic updates will return after 0.9.8,  &amp;#8220;Updates after 0.9.8, will continue to be automatic, just as the way they were before,&amp;#8221; Haskins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesopinteractive LLC is &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickhaskins.com/2015/07/on-life-and-family/&quot;&gt;looking for a buyer&lt;/a&gt; but after receiving low offers, Haskins has decided to use a broker to facilitate the sale. The broker requested that the rebrand of Lasso be completed before proceeding with the sale process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Editus has a nice ring to it, what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/08/death-of-mobile-web/</link>
	<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile web and mobile in-app behaviour are not binary. When users are in the facebook app, they spend a tremendous amount of time accessing the mobile web through facebook’s own in-app browser. The same for twitter and others. We enter social apps for discovery and then access the mobile web while still in-app. It is a mistake to conflate time spent on the mobile web with time spent in a traditional browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen. Tony Haile of Chartbeat: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonyhaile.com/2015/08/11/a-correction-around-the-death-of-the-mobile-web/&quot;&gt;A correction around the death of the mobile web.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 Adds Statistical Insights</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47740</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-version-5-4-adds-statistical-insights</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=&amp;ct=&quot;&gt;available on the app store&lt;/a&gt; and includes a couple of new features. To compliment the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-5-3-released-with-refreshed-stats-and-a-new-layout-for-posts-and-pages&quot;&gt;improvements to stats in 5.3&lt;/a&gt;, 5.4 adds a new stats screen called insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insights is similar to the Right Now widget in the WordPress dashboard in that it displays a summary of key statistics for a site including, total number of published posts, views, visitors, and the best traffic day. There&amp;#8217;s also a section that displays the current day&amp;#8217;s stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_7433.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47744&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_7433.png?resize=282%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Stat Insights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stat Insights
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 5.4, you could only add images to posts that were stored on the device. WordPress for iOS 5.4 adds the ability to insert images from the WordPress media library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add an image from the WordPress media library, select media library from the menu at the top of the screen. If you have a lot of items in the media library, it may take a few minutes to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WPiPhoneMediaLibrary.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-47746&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WPiPhoneMediaLibrary.png?resize=500%2C399&quot; alt=&quot;WP For iOS 5.4 Media Library Selection&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other improvements include the ability to search the My Sites list and viewing embedded images in comments. This makes it easier to see the full context of a comment without having to view it in a different part of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the team fixed a bug that caused the app to not restore its state properly. WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=&amp;ct=&quot;&gt;free and available&lt;/a&gt; on the app store. If you encounter any issues, you&amp;#8217;re encouraged to report them on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ios.forums.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress for iOS support forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Short Interview With Nikolay Bachiyski WordPress’ Security Czar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47728</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/short-interview-with-nikolay-bachiyski-wordpress-security-czar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While on stage at &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Europe&lt;/a&gt; answering a question related to WordPress’ security track record, Matt Mullenweg named &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/nbachiyski&quot;&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski&lt;/a&gt; as the first Security Czar for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Bachiyski to learn why the role was created and what its purpose is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the responsibilities of your new role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responsibilities are to coordinate the security efforts of&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;mostly with incident response and to make sure we respond quickly, have solid fixes, and make sure everyone involved is informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What circumstances led to this role&amp;#8217;s creation?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing too spicy around the creation of the role. As the volume of requests increased, we realized a bit more structure would be helpful so that we are more focused and use our resources wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you only handle security issues for the open source project or will you also help with Automattic’s bounty program as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other colleagues at Automattic who are responsible for the bounty program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are the connections and trust you’ve established over the last 11 years to your role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offline relationships are very important in an online community and I am lucky to know many of the members of the security team in person. This definitely makes working with them easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn More About the WordPress Security Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;d like to learn more about who&amp;#8217;s on the WordPress security team, what they do, and how they handle security releases, listen to my interview with Gary Pendergast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pendergast who works for Automattic, is a WordPress core contributor, and a member of the WordPress core security team. In the interview, we discuss what happened behind the scenes before &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/plugin-developers-demand-a-better-security-release-process-after-wordpress-4-2-3-breaks-thousands-of-websites&quot;&gt;4.2.3 was released&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Avis GPS</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45255</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/08/avis-gps/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After an amazing WordCamp Scranton on Saturday I was heading to a friend&amp;#8217;s birthday on Long Island on Sunday, a few people were surprised I had flown from New York and said driving took about the same amount of time when you factor in all the airport hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Google Mapped it and it did look like it was only 5-6 hours from Scranton to where I was going. Being a born and raised Texan, I love a good drive, and I probably haven&amp;#8217;t had a proper road trip since my sister&amp;#8217;s birthday a few years ago when we went up Highway 1. I&amp;#8217;ve also never driven on the East Coast, and it seemed like there were some really pretty parks and lakes in between Scranton and Long Island so I ended up going to the airport anyway because that&amp;#8217;s where the rental cars were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avis.com/&quot;&gt;Avis&lt;/a&gt;. They try harder. &lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/s.ma.tt/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=604&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt; One thing they do that&amp;#8217;s pretty cool is sell  decent cables, USB wall chargers, and car chargers for a cheap price right at the check-in desk. (I always carry my own car charger, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Incase-Speed-Charger-Lightning-Cable/dp/B00P7Y6M2Y/&quot;&gt;this is my current pick&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s super-handy in Ubers as well.) Amazingly though they still try to give you one of those Garmin GPS units that&amp;#8217;s worse than your smartphone in every possible way. I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s a money maker, otherwise the only reasonable thing to do would be provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O5JARCI&quot;&gt;a smartphone mount&lt;/a&gt; (or have one already set up in the car) rather than saddling people with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/559938/ref=zg_b_bs_559938_1&quot;&gt;archaic, non-networked navigation device&lt;/a&gt; that has no idea about construction or traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up going to a Walmart that was nearby to pick up a car mount (price, $12) that ended up being a life-saver for the trip. &lt;strong&gt;I also believe that every person in tech should visit Walmart at least once a year, and spend time in their technology section.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s good to understand and see how people who don&amp;#8217;t live for technology every day interact with it. It&amp;#8217;s eye-opening, and it&amp;#8217;s handy to know what&amp;#8217;s in stock in case you need 50 feet of ethernet at 4 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping the car off in Manhattan, it looks like they charged me $20 for a GPS which I don&amp;#8217;t even have, so now going to need to sort out both the fee and the &amp;#8220;missing&amp;#8221; GPS system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl; dr: Smart car rental companies should ditch the GPS, provide smartphone mounts instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Organizing Team Explains Why Philadelphia Should Host WordCamp US</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47699</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/organizing-team-explains-why-philadelphia-should-host-wordcamp-us</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When organizing teams in different &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2015-now-accepting-applications-for-host-city&quot;&gt;cities applied to host&lt;/a&gt; WordCamp US earlier this year, they provided a substantial amount of information through the application process. While &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/philadelphia-pa-to-host-wordcamp-us-december-4th-6th&quot;&gt;Philadelphia will host&lt;/a&gt; the event in 2015 and 2016, their application is not public information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juliana Reyes, who writes for &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly&quot;&gt;Technical.ly Philly&lt;/a&gt;, acquired and &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly/2015/08/11/wordcamp-us-philadelphia-wordpress-devs/&quot;&gt;published a few&lt;/a&gt; of the responses from the organizing team&amp;#8217;s application, specifically questions four, nine, ten, and eleven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question nine on the application asks, why do you think your city should host WordCamp US 2015? The organizing team responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Philadelphia is the birthplace of our nation. The United States started here, and so should WordCamp US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’re ideally situated on the East Coast between New York and Washington DC, and the halfway point between the West Coast and parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With a population of 1.5 million, it is the 5th largest city in North America, and is a cultural hub for all things food, music, art, and technology. It is well-known for its many excellent medical and educational facilities, including the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Drexel University, and the University of the Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With over 1,200 daily inbound and outbound flights, Philadelphia is easy to reach from anywhere in the world. The average hotel room and cost of living, is far below any other major East Coast city, and nowhere else has cheesesteaks like we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve yet to visit Philadelphia but one thing I&amp;#8217;ve learned is that residents take their reputation for cheesesteaks seriously. Be sure to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly/2015/08/11/wordcamp-us-philadelphia-wordpress-devs/&quot;&gt;the post&lt;/a&gt; to see the team&amp;#8217;s responses to the other three questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: ThemeConf a Conference for Front-End Developers and Designers September 2nd-4th, 2015</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47686</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/themeconf-a-conference-for-front-end-developers-and-designers-september-2nd-4th-2015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ThemeConfLogo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-47688&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ThemeConfLogo.png?resize=215%2C181&quot; alt=&quot;ThemeConf Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://themeconf.com/&quot;&gt;ThemeConf&lt;/a&gt; is a new conference set to take place September 2nd-4th, 2015, in Keswick, England aimed at front-end developers and designers. Confirmed speakers include a handful of Automattic theme wranglers, Noel Tock of Human Made, freelancer Adam Onishi, and Chris Hutchinson of The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session schedule is expected to be released later this week however, here are some of the topics that will be covered at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Craft, workflow and best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser performance and developer tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and photography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript and REST APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Lenox and Tammie Lister, who are the primary organizers of the event, originally came up with the idea for ThemeConf at the Automattic UK Christmas dinner, &amp;#8220;Lenox wanted to bring a conference to where he lives in the Lake district and I wanted to do one focusing on themes,&amp;#8221; Lister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two have been planning the event since January of this year. Although most of the confirmed speakers work with WordPress, ThemeConf is not dedicated to it, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s geared to those making themes in general and working on the front end. We have tried hard not to focus on WordPress,&amp;#8221; Lister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.to/themeconf/2015&quot;&gt;Tickets for ThemeConf&lt;/a&gt; are £49 and £99 respectively. The £49 tickets are for speaker sessions only while the £99 tickets include access to a workshop on using the REST API and lunch. Accommodations in the Lake District two hours from Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Liverpool and Leeds are available through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keswick.org/&quot;&gt;Keswick.org.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Surpasses One Billion Total Downloads</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47673</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-surpasses-one-billion-total-downloads</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The WordPress project achieved a milestone earlier today as the official WordPress plugin directory &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/&quot;&gt;surpassed one billion&lt;/a&gt; total downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1billiondownloads.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47674&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1billiondownloads.png?resize=944%2C312&quot; alt=&quot;One billion total plugin downloads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;More than one billion total downloads
&lt;p&gt;According to Scott Reilly who helps maintain WordPress.org, we&amp;#8217;ll never know which plugin generated the one billionth download. That&amp;#8217;s because WordPress.org doesn&amp;#8217;t log information that matches downloads to plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A download counter exists for each plugin for each day and the total amount is the summation of all those daily download counts,&amp;#8221; Reilly said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As WordPress&amp;#8217; &lt;a href=&quot;http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all&quot;&gt;market share&lt;/a&gt; continues to grow, so does the amount of downloads from the plugin directory. The following numbers are the total amount of downloads from March 2006 to August 2015. This year, the directory is on pace to serve more than 300 million downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 2006  191,567&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2007  2,845,802&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2008  15,130,856&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2009  49,822,116&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2010  72,342,598&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2011  108,501,907&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2012  141,609,682&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2013  182,236,517&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014  241,142,505&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 2015 to August 2015  186,243,700&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took nine years for the plugin directory to reach one billion downloads, when do you think it will reach two billion?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: SkiPress a Week Long Excursion in the French Alps</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47654</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SkiPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-47658&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SkiPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=852%2C269&quot; alt=&quot;SkiPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you enjoy skiing and WordPress, mark your calendars for &lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;SkiPress&lt;/a&gt;, November 21-28, 2015. SkiPress is a week long excursion to Serre Chevalier, a ski resort in the French Alps. The cottage can hold up to 15 people where attendees can ski, discuss WordPress, develop code, or disconnect from technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;Bernard-Jacquet&lt;/a&gt; who writes for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-spread.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WP-spread&lt;/a&gt;, and helps organize the local WordPress meetup in Grenoble, France, is organizing the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooms at the cottage cost 350 euros. This amount covers the room for a week plus dinner at two restaurants. Prepare to bring some extra cash as the bus, skipass, and ski rental are additional costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s not an official deadline to book a room but the sooner you book the better. If you&amp;#8217;re interested in booking a room, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;contact Berard-Jacquet&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible so he can make arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Richard Best Publishes Human Readable Version of the GPLv2 License</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47645</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/richard-best-publishes-human-readable-version-of-the-gplv2-license</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is licensed under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/&quot;&gt;GPLv2&lt;/a&gt; and the four freedoms it allows is considered to be its &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/&quot;&gt;Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt;. The four freedoms are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to benefit from your changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more to the GPL than the four freedoms listed above however, the license details can be difficult to read and decipher. Richard Best, a qualified lawyer in New Zealand, England, and Wales, has published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpandlegalstuff.com/a-human-readable-summary-of-the-gpl/&quot;&gt;human readable summary&lt;/a&gt; of the GPL license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by how Creative Commons offers a &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot;&gt;human readable version&lt;/a&gt; of its licenses, the summary explains the core concepts of the GPL and outlines the position in relation to copying, distribution, fees, modifications/derivative works, distributing non-source forms, termination, and downstream licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to note that the document is not endorsed by the Free Software Foundation nor a substitute for the full license text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GPLSummarySample2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47647&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GPLSummarySample2.png?resize=705%2C554&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of the human readable summary of the GPL&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sample of the human readable summary of the GPL
&lt;p&gt;I encourage everyone participating in the WordPress ecosystem to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/&quot;&gt;full license&lt;/a&gt; text at least once. However, the summary does a good job explaining the core components of the GPL without having to dig into the license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions concerning the GPL, I suggest seeking legal council with a lawyer familiar with software licensing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress Core Team Receives Praise for Their Efforts to Maintain Security</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47619</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-core-team-receives-praise-for-their-efforts-to-maintain-security</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Netanel Rubin, a vulnerability researcher for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.checkpoint.com/&quot;&gt;Check Point Software&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/&quot;&gt;credited&lt;/a&gt; for properly disclosing a security vulnerability to WordPress, published the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/08/04/wordpress-vulnerabilities-1/&quot;&gt;first in a trilogy of posts&lt;/a&gt; that explains how he discovered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability was discovered during a full audit of WordPress&amp;#8217; code base in which Rubin praised the efforts of the WordPress development team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to these frequent findings in 3rd party plug-ins’ code, barebones WordPress issues are rare, as WordPress core developers are well-trained to hold high security awareness for all released code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can confirm that during our audit of the source code, we witnessed the developers ‘leaving nothing to chance’, and implementing multiple layers of security protecting most attack vectors we could think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress developers deserve praise for their efforts to maintain such complex software in this level of security, specifically considering the presence of the notoriously trigger-happy foot-gun called PHP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/08/04/wordpress-vulnerabilities-1/&quot;&gt;reading the post&lt;/a&gt; as it&amp;#8217;s a brief look into the mind of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat&quot;&gt;white hat&lt;/a&gt; security researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although WordPress has &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-4-patches-six-security-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;seen its fair share&lt;/a&gt; of security related releases this year, it&amp;#8217;s reassuring to hear a third-party whose job it is to penetrate software security praise WordPress&amp;#8217; codebase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The Mantra of Family Comes First</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47609</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-mantra-of-family-comes-first</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FamilyFirstFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47611&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FamilyFirstFeaturedImage.png?resize=669%2C247&quot; alt=&quot;Family First Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/63122283@N06/11867028263&quot;&gt;Mama&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/recap-of-prestige-a-conference-geared-towards-growing-businesses&quot;&gt;Prestige over the weekend&lt;/a&gt;, I heard a presenter say that family comes first. This isn&amp;#8217;t the first time I&amp;#8217;ve heard this advice but it&amp;#8217;s becoming more prevalent. I generally hear this advice from those who are living comfortably, have two kids or more, and/or have gone through the startup process more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a distributed worker who receives a check every two weeks. I&amp;#8217;m married, have no kids, and write about WordPress for a living. Putting family first should be easy but it&amp;#8217;s not. The last two years as a distributed worker, I&amp;#8217;ve put work before family unless it&amp;#8217;s an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, my wife and I had a serious conversation about the way I work and how it has negatively impacted our marriage. I&amp;#8217;m a late owl and on most nights, my wife sleeps alone. As a distributed worker, I get to make the rules and put myself in the best environment to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation with my wife involved words not fit for reproduction but everything she said was right. I&amp;#8217;m spending too much time on digital devices and not enough with her. Our conversation was the wake up call I didn&amp;#8217;t know I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not easy putting family first all the time. Some argue that you need to put yourself before family so that you can provide for them. Others find a critical balance between spending time with family and getting the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you put family first when there are bills that need to be paid, sites to be built, and a constant deluge of work to be done? Please share your thoughts, experiences, and advice in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress 4.2.4 Patches Six Security Vulnerabilities</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47605</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-4-patches-six-security-vulnerabilities</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/&quot;&gt;4.2.4 is available&lt;/a&gt; and patches six security vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities were discovered by outside parties and members of the WordPress core security team. This release also fixes four bugs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WPDB: When checking the encoding of strings against the database, make sure we&amp;#8217;re only relying on the return value of strings that were sent to the database. &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32279&quot;&gt;#32279&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t blindly trust the output of &lt;tt&gt;glob()&lt;/tt&gt; to be an array. &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33093&quot;&gt;#33093&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcodes: Handle &lt;tt&gt;do_shortcode('&amp;lt;[shortcode]')&lt;/tt&gt; edge cases. &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33116&quot;&gt;#33116&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcodes: Protect newlines inside of &lt;tt&gt;CDATA&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33106&quot;&gt;#33106&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a busy year for the WordPress security team. Since the beginning of the year, there has been five security releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-1-2/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.1.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.2.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/05/wordpress-4-2-2/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.2.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-2-3/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.2.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.2.4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users should check their sites to make sure they&amp;#8217;re running 4.2.4. If your site hasn&amp;#8217;t automatically updated yet, you should perform a full backup and manually update. Sites running WordPress RC 2 are safe since it fixes the same issues as 4.2.4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Recap of Prestige a Conference Geared Towards Growing Businesses</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47580</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/recap-of-prestige-a-conference-geared-towards-growing-businesses</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PrestigeconfFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47595&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PrestigeconfFeaturedImage.png?resize=677%2C268&quot; alt=&quot;Tony Perez of Sucuri&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tony Perez of Sucuri Presenting on Security at Prestige
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I attended &lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige&lt;/a&gt;, a conference geared towards freelancers, entrepreneurs, and small agencies looking to grow their businesses. Unlike WordCamps, plugins, themes, and WordPress in general were rarely mentioned. Instead, sessions included high level topics such as, how to land enterprise clients, knowing when to move on to the next big thing, and the benefits of partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue was perfect with plenty of space and the WiFi worked well. Lunch was an hour-long and provided on both days. The lunchroom can easily seat 300 people or more. Only a third of the space was used when attendees ate lunch providing a great environment to network with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nancy Lyons and Technology&amp;#8217;s Dirty Little Secret&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don&amp;#8217;t deal with clients or own an agency, many of the sessions at Prestige are non-applicable to my day job. However, there is one session in particular that resonated with me. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nancylyons.com/&quot;&gt;Nancy Lyons&lt;/a&gt;, founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clockwork.net/&quot;&gt;Clockwork&lt;/a&gt;, shared her philosophies on hiring and getting employees engaged. Happy employees do good work but what makes them happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autonomy:  Control over time, technique, team, or task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastery: Make progress and get better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purpose: Be part of something bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the tips shared by Lyons are geared towards employers but they&amp;#8217;re just as applicable to employees. The biggest danger to agencies and freelancers is the inability to have conversations with clients about what is and isn&amp;#8217;t possible. According to Lyons, you can love someone and still tell them what they need to hear. One of the best tips she shared is to find and have fun at work as there&amp;#8217;s nothing wrong with having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Behind the Scenes of the Livestream&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prestige is &lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/free-livestream-minneapolis-2015/&quot;&gt;known for having&lt;/a&gt; a high quality livestream where more than 1,000 people can watch the conference live. The livestream is produced by &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixpromedia.com/&quot;&gt;PixProMedia&lt;/a&gt;. The gentleman in charge uses a TriCaster to switch between speakers and slides during sessions. Here are a couple of photographs of his equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to some viewers, watching the livestream was like being at the conference but is not a substitute for face-to-face interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffr0&quot;&gt;@jeffr0&lt;/a&gt; The learning is like being there.  I miss the handshakes in the hallway, meeting people face-to-face.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/prestigeconf?src=hash&quot;&gt;#prestigeconf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cate DeRosia (@mysweetcate) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mysweetcate/status/627924263799009280&quot;&gt;August 2, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Westwerk Is a Great Venue for After Parties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The after party was held at &lt;a href=&quot;http://westwerk.com/&quot;&gt;Westwerk&lt;/a&gt;, a WordPress development agency and primary sponsor of the event. Their office was perfect for an after party as it includes, a foosball table, Nintendo Wii, shuffleboard, drinks, pool table, and small offices for private conversations. It&amp;#8217;s one of the best after parties for a conference that I&amp;#8217;ve attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prestige is Serious Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem like a WordPress conference on the surface but Prestige is geared towards business minded people. It&amp;#8217;s highly focused and filled with information you can apply to companies in and outside of WordPress. If you want to learn how to take your business to the next level, Prestige is an excellent value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: How to Avoid This Embarrassing Sharing Bug on WordPress.com</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47476</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/how-to-avoid-embarrassing-sharing-bug-on-wordpress-com</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you use the sharing feature on WordPress.com, you may have noticed an anomaly between your post title and what&amp;#8217;s shared to social services. Since the post title is the first field to complete when writing a post, it makes sense to fill it in even if it&amp;#8217;s a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharing module on WordPress.com has a bug where the initial text in a post title is used when sharing the post to social networks. For the past several months, I&amp;#8217;ve published many articles on WordPress.com where the text within social links does not match the text used in the post title leaving me feeling embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BuginAction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47477&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BuginAction.png?resize=728%2C482&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress.com Bug in Action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress.com Bug in Action
&lt;p&gt;To avoid this embarrassment, you&amp;#8217;ll need to alter the text used in the sharing module before publishing each post. If you&amp;#8217;re using the New Dash interface on WordPress.com, locate the Sharing metabox as seen in the screenshot above. When you&amp;#8217;re ready to hit the publish button, change the text to match your title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/TheCorrectPostTitle.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47478&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/TheCorrectPostTitle.png?resize=571%2C462&quot; alt=&quot;Post Title Matches the Sharing Text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Post Title Matches the Sharing Text
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spoken to several Automattic employees at various WordPress events and they&amp;#8217;re aware of the bug. Until it&amp;#8217;s fixed, you&amp;#8217;ll need to remember to change the sharing text before you publish a post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.3 make it even easier to format your content and customize your site.</p>
<p><iframe width='692' height='389' src='https://videopress.com/embed/T54Iy7Tw?hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1435166243'></script></p>
<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.4">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33573&amp;stop_rev=33396">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.4</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.4.</p>

<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 4 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta4.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, check out the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">Beta 1</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-2/">Beta 2</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-3/">Beta 3</a> blog posts. Some of the changes in Beta 4 include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="s1">Fixed several bugs and broken flows in the </span><span class="s1"><strong>publish box </strong></span><span class="s1">in the edit screen.</span></li>
<li>Addressed a number of edge cases for word count in the <strong>editor</strong>.</li>
<li><span class="s1"><strong>Site icons</strong> </span><span class="s1">can now be previewed within the customizer. The feature has been removed from general settings.</span></li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33369&amp;stop_rev=33289">more than 60 changes</a> in the last week.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you’ve found a bug, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. Or, if you’re comfortable writing a bug report, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 2 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you’ve found a bug, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums.

<p><em>Edges polished up</em><br />
<em>Features meliorated</em><br />
<em>Beta Two: go test!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week saw the halfway point for 2015, yay! This seems like a good time to update you on WordCamp happenings in the first half of this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.2 is now available. This is a <strong>critical security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>Version 4.2.2 addresses two security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Genericons icon font package, which is used in a number of popular themes and plugins, contained an HTML file vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. All affected themes and plugins hosted on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> (including the Twenty Fifteen default theme) have been updated today by the WordPress security team to address this issue by removing this nonessential file. To help protect other Genericons usage, WordPress 4.2.2 proactively scans the wp-content directory for this HTML file and removes it. Reported by Robert Abela of <a href="http://netsparker.com">Netsparker</a>.</li>
<li>WordPress versions 4.2 and earlier are affected by a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/">critical cross-site scripting vulnerability</a>, which could enable anonymous users to compromise a site. WordPress 4.2.2 includes a comprehensive fix for this issue. Reported separately by Rice Adu and Tong Shi from Baidu[X-team].</li>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.3 make it even easier to format your content and customize your site.</p>
<p><iframe width='692' height='389' src='https://videopress.com/embed/T54Iy7Tw?hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1435166243'></script></p>
<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.4">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33573&amp;stop_rev=33396">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.4</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.4.</p>
<p><em>Already testing WordPress 4.3? The second release candidate is now available (<a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-RC2.zip">zip</a>) and it contains these fixes. For more on 4.3, see <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-release-candidate/">the RC 1 announcement post</a>.</em></p>

<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 2 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you’ve found a bug, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. Or, if you’re comfortable writing a bug report, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=4.3&amp;group=component&amp;order=priority">everything we’ve fixed</a>.</p>
<p><em>Edges polished up</em><br />
<em>Features meliorated</em><br />
<em>Beta Two: go test!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week saw the halfway point for 2015, yay! This seems like a good time to update you on WordCamp happenings in the first half of this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Site icons for all</em><br />
<em>Live preview menu changes</em><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.2 is now available. This is a <strong>critical security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>Version 4.2.2 addresses two security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Genericons icon font package, which is used in a number of popular themes and plugins, contained an HTML file vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. All affected themes and plugins hosted on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> (including the Twenty Fifteen default theme) have been updated today by the WordPress security team to address this issue by removing this nonessential file. To help protect other Genericons usage, WordPress 4.2.2 proactively scans the wp-content directory for this HTML file and removes it. Reported by Robert Abela of <a href="http://netsparker.com">Netsparker</a>.</li>
<li>WordPress versions 4.2 and earlier are affected by a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/">critical cross-site scripting vulnerability</a>, which could enable anonymous users to compromise a site. WordPress 4.2.2 includes a comprehensive fix for this issue. Reported separately by Rice Adu and Tong Shi from Baidu[X-team].</li>
</ul>
<p>The release also includes hardening for a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability when using the visual editor. This issue was reported by Mahadev Subedi.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.2 also contains fixes for 13 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.2">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=32418&amp;stop_rev=32324">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.2</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.2.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.2:</p>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress.com Unveils the Action Bar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47954</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-unveils-the-action-bar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/new-action-bar/&quot;&gt;unveiled a new user interface&lt;/a&gt; called the Action Bar. It&amp;#8217;s a bar that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen for logged in users and is accessible from any device. The bar performs multiple tasks depending on the page you&amp;#8217;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47955&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png?resize=1025%2C627&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Action Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress Action Bar
&lt;p&gt;When on a WordPress.com powered site that you&amp;#8217;re not following, the bar turns into a Follow button. Clicking the follow button will notify you of new posts published on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47956&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png?resize=192%2C60&quot; alt=&quot;Action Bar Follow Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Action Bar Follow Button
&lt;p&gt;If you click the three dots to the right, you&amp;#8217;ll see a variety of options depending upon the page you&amp;#8217;re viewing. If it&amp;#8217;s the homepage, you&amp;#8217;ll see links to download the theme the site uses, report the content, or manage the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re browsing a specific post on a WordPress.com site, you&amp;#8217;ll see an additional link to copy a shortlink for quick and easy sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47957&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png?resize=265%2C319&quot; alt=&quot;Easily Share Posts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easily Share Posts
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com and are logged in, the Follow button turns into a Customize button. This link provides a quick way to enter the Customizer. There&amp;#8217;s also an Edit link if you&amp;#8217;re browsing a published post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47958&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png?resize=307%2C348&quot; alt=&quot;Edit and Customize Links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Edit and Customize Links
&lt;p&gt;If the action bar is too big and you want to minimize it, click the three dots and select the option to Collapse the bar. It will shrink the bar into squares and get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the action bar is the ability to quickly see and download a theme used on a WordPress.com site. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for WordPress.com specific sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailypost.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The Daily Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What annoys me about the action bar is that it disappears when I scroll down. I caught myself scrolling down to read a post and when I looked for the edit button to fix a typo, the action bar was gone. I think it should stay on the screen at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to see the Edit link in the action bar open a front-end editor. It&amp;#8217;s time WordPress.com step up its game and stop forcing users through a backend interface to edit published content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the experimental action bar but at the same time, I question the reasoning for adding yet another user interface element to mimic actions already supported by other buttons and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, between the admin bar, dashboard, the edit link underneath a post, and the action bar, there are now four different ways to edit a post. How many roads are necessary to reach the same destination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com, let me know what you think of the action bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.3.3 Patches Security Vulnerabilities in BuddyPress Messages Component</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47948</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-3-patches-security-vulnerabilities-in-buddypress-messages-component</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-41978&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=828%2C265&quot; alt=&quot;BuddyPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3&lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2015/08/buddypress-2-3-3/&quot;&gt; is available&lt;/a&gt; and users are encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;update as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. A few security vulnerabilities were discovered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/buddypress-components-and-features/#internal-messaging&quot;&gt;BuddyPress Messages, &lt;/a&gt;a core component that allows users to send and receive private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to the BuddyPress team that could allow members to manipulate a failed private outbound message and inject unexpected output to the browser. The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof Katowicz-Kowalewski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the first vulnerability, the BuddyPress core development team independently discovered and fixed related vulnerabilities with the messages component that could allow for carefully crafted private message content to be rendered incorrectly to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3 also fixes a couple of bugs in the 2.3 codebase and improves support for backend changes made in WordPress 4.3. To protect your sites from these vulnerabilities, you should perform a full backup and &lt;strong&gt;update BuddyPress as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Theme Review Team Begins Phasing Out Favicon Support</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47940</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-begins-phasing-out-favicon-support</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main features in WordPress 4.3 are Site Icons. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icon&lt;/a&gt; is an image that represents a website across multiple platforms and replaces Favicons. With Site Icons in WordPress core, the WordPress Theme Review team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;phasing out the feature&lt;/a&gt; in existing themes hosted in the theme directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;p&gt;Justin Tadlock, a theme review admin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;published a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to provide a backwards compatible experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tadlock, the easiest method is to check if the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; function exists. This tells you if the user is running WordPress 4.3 and has the site icon feature available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check if the user has set up a new icon using the core WordPress feature by using the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; conditional tag which returns either &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some example code from the tutorial you can use to handle the check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ( ! function_exists( 'has_site_icon' ) || ! has_site_icon() ) {

    // Output old, custom favicon feature.
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional information, I encourage you to read&lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/wordpress/development/backwards-compatibility-site-icons/&quot;&gt; Stephen Cronin&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; which goes into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Theme Review Team enforces a guideline where features added to core are phased out of themes within two major releases. By the time WordPress 4.5 is released, theme authors will be able to remove legacy code without disrupting the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/08/26/2015-wordpress-community-summit-dates-announced/&quot;&gt;WordPress community summit&lt;/a&gt; will take place on December 2-3, 2015, in Philadelphia, PA two days before WordCamp US. The summit&amp;nbsp;will be held at &lt;a href=&quot;http://philadelphia.impacthub.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Impact Hub Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, a co-working space where freelancers, entrepreneurs, and social innovators work together, share ideas, and build networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ImpactHub.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47931&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ImpactHub.jpg?resize=500%2C333&quot; alt=&quot;inside Impact Hub&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Inside Impact HubImpact Hub is spacious and has dedicated meeting and conference rooms. According to the announcement, the summit is invite only similar to last year’s event at WordCamp San Francisco:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WordPress Community Summit is a smaller, invite-only event for&amp;nbsp;active members and contributors on the many teams that work to improve&amp;nbsp;WordPress: Core, Design, Mobile, Accessibility, Support, Polygots, Documentation, Themes, Plugins, Community, Meta, Training, Flow&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;TV .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey or application form will soon be published which will result in a pool from which the attendees will be invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit is a rare opportunity for members of various contributor teams to focus and work together in the same physical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual WordPress Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use, build, or make a living with WordPress, please take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2015&quot;&gt;annual survey&lt;/a&gt;. Results will be shared during Matt Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation at WordCamp US. The more people who fill out the survey, the more representative the data will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation from 2014 to see results from the previous survey.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Stream Is Shutting Down Its Cloud Data Storage October 1st</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47925</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/stream-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-data-storage-october-1st</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/introducing-stream-3/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt; and includes some significant improvements. Stream is a WordPress plugin that tracks changes to a site similar to an audit trail. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service&quot;&gt;version two was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, it morphed from a plugin to a service. Activity logs were stored in the cloud which lessened the amount of resources used on local webservers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version three will no longer store data in the cloud. Instead, it will store activity logs locally. The cloud service provided by Stream 2 is closing on &lt;strong&gt;October 1st&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives users a little more than a month to migrate data from the cloud to their local webserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cloud is Expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Carbis, lead developer of Stream, says the time frame was chosen based on a number of factors, &amp;#8220;We chose a 6 week migration window as a balance between bleeding cash and doing the right thing by our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s also helpful to remember that the vast majority of our users are on a Free plan, which only includes 12 weeks of storage. We are monitoring the accounts of each of our paid users and I&amp;#8217;m personally making sure that every one of them has migrated,&amp;#8221; Carbis told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move away from the cloud is largely based on cost. The majority of Stream&amp;#8217;s customers signed up to the free plan with a significant lack of interest in the Pro Subscription. Server costs were also higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XWP to The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lack of income from Stream 2 and acquisition talks failing, Carbis was contracted to do outside work leaving Frankie Jarrett the only person working on the project. Stream&amp;#8217;s investor decided to pull the plug on the project at the same time Jarrett decided to resign from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I heard that Frankie had resigned I gave him a call. We reminisced on our achievements, and threw around some of our ideas on what could have been. That conversation renewed my inspiration. I jotted down some notes, and that’s when things started to turn around,&amp;#8221; Carbis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members from &lt;a href=&quot;https://xwp.co/&quot;&gt;XWP&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to lend a helping hand and the project is now officially under the XWP umbrella. This allows Stream to remain free and open source. The partnership will also facilitate add-on, connectors, and adapters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New in Stream 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is rewritten from the ground up. Activity logs use half the space in the database compared to Stream 2. It supports multisite through the use of Network Admin and uses a dependency injection model to be more extendable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Stream 3 includes a variety of improvements two notable features have been removed, Notifications and Reports. If you depend on these features, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/stream-3-faq/&quot;&gt;review the following FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbis and XWP are taking Stream into a new direction. Stream&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wp-stream/roadmap/&quot;&gt;proposed roadmap&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub and Carbis encourages users to not only review it, but to contribute to the project&amp;#8217;s future, &amp;#8220;I’d like to see Stream’s users contribute more to its direction. Contribution isn’t limited to ideas either. If you can design, develop, or translate, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wp-stream/stream&quot;&gt;contributing to the Stream project&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if Stream can regain the momentum it lost after transitioning to a cloud based system to store data. Now that Stream stores activity logs locally again, those in the EU should be able to use it without breaking privacy laws. Stream is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; on the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Akismet: Quantifying Reddit Bigotry</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1859</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/08/27/quantifying-reddit-bigotry/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2015-08-30): It looks like the team who created the tool decided to retire it due to some reported accuracy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never pass on the opportunity to mix in a little bit of humor with our passion for web content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our engineers, Dan Walmsley, participated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedyhackday.org/la-2015&quot;&gt;Cultivated Wit&amp;#8217;s Comedy Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles last weekend, and his team&amp;#8217;s resulting project has since surfaced on &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-tool-quantifies-reddit-bigotry&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/26/reddit-bigotry-check/&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeredditcheck.com/&quot;&gt;Free Reddit Check&lt;/a&gt;, created by Dan&amp;#8217;s team and crowned with the day&amp;#8217;s top prize, is a site which attempts to quantify the terribleness of Reddit users based on their public comment content and subreddit participation. While perfectly suited for a hack day which pairs developers and comedians, there is certainly usefulness in determining the respectability of a potential online acquaintance. Or just knowing who to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being obsessed with content analysis, community moderation, and keeping the web&amp;#8217;s underbelly in check, we can&amp;#8217;t help but think it&amp;#8217;s a nifty idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1859&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: First Look at the Twenty Sixteen Default WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47897</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.4 is the last scheduled major release of the year and with it will come a new default theme to replace Twenty Fifteen. On the Make WordPress Core site, Tammie Lister &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/25/introducing-twenty-sixteen/&quot;&gt;published an image gallery&lt;/a&gt; that shows off the design of Twenty Sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lister, the process of determining the new default theme has taken months, &amp;#8220;Lots of themes were considered, eventually settling on the one you see below. It’s a perfect fit,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47898&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png?resize=433%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen
&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen is designed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi&quot;&gt;Takashi Irie,&lt;/a&gt; who also designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2013/12/13/twenty-fourteen-wordpress-3-8-parker/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fourteen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2015/03/19/twenty-fifteen-the-wordpress-default-theme-for-2015/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; default themes. Irie describes Twenty Sixteen as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modernized approach of an ever-popular layout — a horizontal masthead and an optional right sidebar that works well with both blogs and websites. It has custom color options that allow you to make your own Twenty Sixteen. The theme was designed on a harmonious fluid grid with a mobile first approach. This means it looks great on any device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theme has hints of Twenty Fourteen but is different enough to stand on its own as a unique design. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look as modern as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; out-of-the box but the design could change during the 4.4 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help Twenty Sixteen be the best it can be, please join the weekly meetings held every Monday and Friday at 16:00 UTC in the #core-themes channel on &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt;. The meetings are a half hour-long and start once the theme is initially added to WordPress core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think of Twenty Sixteen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: OSTraining Makes Pods Framework Video Training Series Available for Free</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47885</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/ostraining-makes-pods-framework-video-training-series-available-for-free</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-40653&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg?resize=628%2C290&quot; alt=&quot;pods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/&quot;&gt;OSTraining&lt;/a&gt;, a site that offers video training for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and other technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/blog/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;http://pods.io/&quot;&gt;Pods Framework&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;training series&lt;/a&gt; is now available for free. Steve Burge, founder of OSTraining.com, says offering the video series for free is the result of a partnership with the Pods Framework project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This project came about because the OSTraining and Pods teams bumped into each other on a regular basis. I often ran into Jim True and Josh Pollock from Pods. We met at WordCamps and WordPress meetups in Tampa, Orlando, and Miami, FL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Pods team explained that they were working on improving their documentation. They started a YouTube series, wrote tutorials, and started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/pods-lead-developer-scott-kingsley-clark-launches-friends-of-pods-funding-campaign&quot;&gt;Friends of Pods&lt;/a&gt; initiative to support their efforts. Making the videos free is our way of contributing to the Pods project,&amp;#8221; Burge told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burge recorded the series after using Pods to create the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appalachiantrail.com/&quot;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt; website. The series provides an introduction to Pods, templates, creating a custom taxonomy, and more. Those interested can view the series on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;OSTraining.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk9dCVMQRmSptuJ6YdVzMkr5&amp;v=4rm95kNxRXg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a look at the first video in the series which introduces viewers to the Pods Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was created in 2014, the series contains great insight into the project and provides an educational foundation for learning Pods 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Request: Alex King Rememberances</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=22017</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear WordPress community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apologies for the selfish and personal nature of this post. I hope you will forgive me given the circumstances. As most of you know, I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as &amp;#8220;dad&amp;#8221;, but when she gets older she&amp;#8217;ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent more than a decade in the WordPress community and I&amp;#8217;d like to request that you to share a few thoughts or remembrances about me that we can compile and share with her when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have crossed paths or if I have managed to do something that you found helpful, I&amp;#8217;d love it if you would take a few minutes to write it down and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/contact&quot;&gt;send it to me&lt;/a&gt; or my wife: heatherkingcom@gmail.com. If you&amp;#8217;re willing to have the story shared publicly, please indicate that accordingly. By default, we will keep everything confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the thread: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; an ongoing story on this site. View the thread timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Step Up Your Game: How to Work With Successful WordPress Clients</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47868</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/step-up-your-game-how-to-work-with-successful-wordpress-clients</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47869&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Mario Y. Peshev&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Ryan Hellyer&quot; href=&quot;http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mario Peshev&lt;/a&gt;. Mario is the founder and WordPress Architect at &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/p9TnMSFMi2&quot;&gt;DevriX&lt;/a&gt; building and maintaining large WordPress-driven platforms. With over 10,000 hours of consulting and training, Mario&amp;#8217;s Yin and Yang is his Open Source advocacy and business growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning &amp;#8211; Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47879&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png?resize=682%2C281&quot; alt=&quot;Step up your game featured image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58522126@N00/430932479&quot;&gt;Stairwell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a learnaholic for as long as I can remember and when I read the aforementioned quote, it resonates strongly with me. My prelude to WordPress years ago was one of the steps toward improvement and success and I’ve developed a special love-hate relationship with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utmost admiration about its influence over the world in terms of Open Source and opportunities for various people in different niches, and its plague of being diminished and depreciated by professional developers and successful businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to solve these issues as long as the inner circle works towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are happy building lego type websites with random ThemeForest themes and you see that as your future, this post is not for you. If you love doing the same repeatedly for mom and pop shops, this may not resonate with you. This is applicable to people who want to get better at what they do, be more professional, and make some impact by solving complex problems for larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress For a Better Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, I presented at a conference focused on kids and teenagers to motivate them, prepare them for the adult life, and nurture their creativity. Kids these days hardly think about their future, between their teenage emotional dramas and boring homework assignments. If you think about it, how can they be passionate about becoming someone if they have no real idea what they need to know and do on a daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used WordPress as an example of a platform that children can use, one that provides them with the opportunity to develop a talent or passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using WordPress for homework and general notes (or a diary) could indicate interest in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young bloggers can potentially do creative writing or copywriting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly switching themes and playing with colors might open the room to design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding plugins and trying to implement complex combinations is the first step to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing posts, looking at analytics and comparing different titles or photos is the way to marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other potential areas of course, but as long as kids can associate with an activity, become passionate about it, and start digging into it, they can save years of slacking, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars on college degrees for specialties they couldn’t care less about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why more and more people join the WordPress industry and switch boring jobs in order to make a living off of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Types Of WordPress Services Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of opportunities for WordPress work is incredible but the vast pool of WordPress jobs is so vague and blurry, that hiring and educating talent is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep an eye on dozens of job boards, portals, and freelance networks. Clients look for Virtual Assistants to get their websites built. They look for expert WordPress developers to apply content changes to their site or web designers to develop complex plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis I see references to WordPress administrators, programmers, developers, designers, marketers, digital artists, webmasters, VAs, and plenty of other job titles used improperly. As a matter of fact, I’m now fascinated when I see a WordPress related job post or an offer looking for the right type of candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news is that you can do anything with WordPress. The caveat here is that WordPress itself is not a skill. You don’t ask for an Internet expert nowadays and you don’t go to the same doctor when you have a headache or you’ve injured your leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide industry of innocent clients and amateur service providers have made it nearly impossible to tell a developer from a marketer, or from a general user who has installed WordPress with an auto-installer twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Indecent World of WordPress Experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-39089&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Job Titles Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/5565517971&quot;&gt;I love &amp;#8217;84&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a lot about impostor syndrome in several reputable WordPress blogs, and people keep identifying themselves in the comments. In my opinion, this is a problem so insignificant as compared to the ever-growing pool of people claiming to be WordPress Experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last several years, I’ve interacted with people all around the world working with WordPress. From freelancers to successful business owners at conferences, and from beginner virtual assistants to full-stack consultants in social media, blogs and job networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of service providers that I’ve found is the one of &lt;em&gt;WordPress experts&lt;/em&gt;. You can easily substitute expert with specialist, guru, master, ninja and rockstar. Just open a new tab and do a few quick searches in Google, job networks, social media and view the large number of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list are &lt;em&gt;WordPress developers&lt;/em&gt;. A WordPress developer is often described as people who install plugins. There are various possible scenarios, but this is rarely the definition of an actual developer proficient in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some boards or blogs list specific skills that let you filter by programming language or a separate tool. My latest research with 200 contractors with WordPress developer titles led to 170 people who rate themselves with 4 or 5 out of 5 stars in PHP proficiency, and 30 with 3 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 170 people in the first group, 150 were college students, Internet marketers, VAs, and people who have substituted strings in WordPress themes thanks to support forums or help from the Codex. Not a single line of code was written from scratch, let alone building anything, and 4 out of 5 or higher self-assessed their level of PHP experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom McFarlin &lt;a href=&quot;http://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-developers-programmer-implementer/&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the difference between a developer and implementer and I wrote an overview defining &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-job-titles-dont-mean-much-anymore&quot;&gt;various technical skills in the WordPress context&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the lack of proper training, any official educational resource or meaningful set of skills per role, both finding talent and improving one’s skills is being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge you to interview several successful clients around you who looked for skillful WordPress folks. They either happened to know the right people, were recommended someone, ended up with several freelancers who messed up big time, went AWOL and suddenly took the cash and disappeared, couldn’t deliver, or they did and the site is incredibly slow and/or got hacked soon thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s sending serious businesses away and I won’t touch the topic of under pricing services and products which brings the quality and support way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivates people to use a reliable resource in order to grow? The WordPress Foundation, nor any of the big players provide official training curriculum, and a definition for formal roles. There is no WordPress certification program (I won’t get into that to avoid unnecessary discussions), and there are no clear paths for requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WordPress Community is Filled with Amateurs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, our community is a large group mostly composed of amateurs who started using WordPress one way or another. These people started earning money and reached a point where they don’t know where they stand, what they’re proficient in, if they’re doing fine, whether they’re experts, impostors, or somewhere in the middle, and what would be helpful to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still use FTP and work with PHP 5.2-supported hosts. The most popular theme marketplaces provide products with broken and inconsistent code. The WordPress.org plugin repository accepts plenty of plugins with suspicious consistency and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these issues are recognized publicly in the WordPress community. Some hosts prohibit SSH and allow solely FTP. PHP 5.2 will be supported by Core for a while, which doesn’t motivate hosts to upgrade. Marketplaces earn millions from their top sellers, so they’re not interested in quickly bringing up quality as long as poorly coded themes sell well. There’s also no formal constantly reviewed plugin repository for high quality plugins and no one is actively backing this idea up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the last paragraph as a rant, it’s because it is. It’s meant to be a “wake up call” to clients who don’t know better and service providers who want to become better. While the WordPress Core itself is incredibly stable and flexible, the rest of the infrastructure is mostly poorly coded due to under pricing, lack of skills, and lack of more successful clients interested in backing up WordPress teams and consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of people and plenty of applications of WordPress. Whatever you do, it’s your professional duty to offer the right type of service instead of misleading your clients, and be aware of the other pertinent verticals. Moreover, it’s the only way forward working with reputable organizations and large profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a Successful Client?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-32204&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png?resize=636%2C278&quot; alt=&quot;Success Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeveeaar/2035597695/&quot;&gt;seeveeaar&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige Conference&lt;/a&gt; happened a few weeks ago, and Shane Pearlman from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tri.be/&quot;&gt;Modern Tribe&lt;/a&gt; shared his experience in a presentation entitled, Land the Big Fish: Strategies Acquiring Larger Clients. It’s a motivational talk that outlines different strategies on negotiating and landing larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the session, Pearlman is asked, “What’s in it for me to go through all of that headache to procure bigger brand names?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated at the beginning, working with successful clients is not for everyone. Some people are afraid to leave their comfort zone. Others are too lazy to learn new skills or sometimes doing the same thing repeatedly may be their perfect job. For every other entrepreneur or business player, successful clients are exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each small change is magnified when working with successful clients. Usually, they have a lot of employees, a solid budget for marketing and advertising, a lot of traffic, and various complex requirements that help them attract more leads or automate their processes. T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hey are often respectable and have access to more capital. This allows them to invest more since their return of investment is worth it; while taking a risk due to saving a few bucks could very well ruin their reputation and harm their business. There are several examples of products or companies in the WordPress community that were hacked or where updates caused major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with successful clients is extremely rewarding and exciting, but getting there requires ace skills and solid experience, as well as the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Target Successful Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience with banks, telecoms, automotive, airline brands, large educational institutions and media outlets over the last 12 years as a developer and a technical lead, there are several specific areas where courageous WordPress freelancers and small business owners can focus on if they are aiming for growth and successful clients, but aren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have identified some steps for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/08/8-steps-to-move-from-freelancer-to-successful-company/&quot;&gt;moving from a freelancer to a successful company&lt;/a&gt;. Here is what we should focus on in the WordPress context in order to step up our game, understand our industry better, and start acting professionally if we want to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress is a Vague Term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a WordPress Expert says nothing. You may be a lead developer of WordPress or someone who can memorize the order of all submenus under Settings in the admin dashboard. Both are classified as WordPress experts and that’s what many people don’t realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialize in a given niche and polish your skills. Focus on a specific group of projects &amp;#8211; membership websites, eCommerce stores, multisite installs. Become a know-it-all professional for an extensible plugin such as, BuddyPress, Gravity Forms, or Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the value you are providing and what it corresponds to. Be respectful to the broad community of professionals in your area, learn from them, ask them to be your mentors. Even the best athletes and CEOs have coaches, business mentors, and boards of directors. Find out what it is that you do whether it’s design, development, marketing, or something else and learn the skill inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Installments Don’t Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people offer WordPress services as an add-on to their portfolio of other services without realizing the impact it has on the business. While WordPress is used for plenty of purposes, it’s still a technical platform that comes with its own specific set of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what will happen if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a vulnerable plugin that is exploited and your client’s password is stolen, along with their private details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You forget to protect the media uploader and the client uploads sensitive data. Scanned images of contracts and ID cards end up in the public space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your sitemap plugin indexes protected data since you used a plugin that doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a site and sell it to a client, and due to the terrible choice of plugins, the site crashes miserably and kills the server during a demonstration in front of their big clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a small list of what ifs, but they happen all the time. If you don’t possess the skills or offer the wrong service, this could damage your client’s business. Upping your game and providing solutions instead of websites allows you to take care of the infrastructure, maintenance work, support, development, security, marketing of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, be aware of the consequences and partner up with other agencies and consultants. Complete packages are what successful clients look for and inexperienced people often mess up what others have built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Expert Skills Won’t Cut It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients look for professional skills. They have real problems that can’t be solved with yet another plugin, and they are smart enough to know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the business of configuring themes and installing a few plugins for clients, that won’t do it for successful customers. You need to specialize in code, design, user experience, marketing, or something else that brings real value to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large clients are looking for state of the art designs, performant and secure code, brilliant marketing skills, and growth hacking strategy. Large clients are successful because they are outstanding at what they do, the services they offer, and they appreciate high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context-Specific WordPress Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations take their marketing presence and technical stack seriously. They carefully delegate based on multiple factors. Being in a meeting with a large client typically means discussing a use case together with several people such as, a creative director, VP of marketing, network engineer, and project manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being skillful in your niche and ready to provide value, you have to learn the business processes of your target client. Your idea of a solution may be applicable for small sites, but it may very well be a bad fit based on the company policy or the variety of services used by the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, a creative director may require you to prepare your theme to be ADA Section 508 compliant, which is an accessibility standard required by certain organizations. The VP of marketing may ask for a Hubspot integration with Cvent within your website for proper CRM and meeting request management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network engineer could outline that they need to host the solution on-site, and set up a specific set of web application firewalls and internal web server security rules restricting certain process callbacks. The project manager might share a complicated timeline based on the organization load, holiday schedule, decision maker’s availability, conferences, and various deliverables that need to be presented by different people and other third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are things that we’ve been asked for over the past few months. If you are used to working with a specific host using Apache, prepare for writing documentation and shipping to a restricted server running HHVM. If you use a framework that isn’t accessible, you will need to step back, explore the Section 508 standards, and build something compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic solutions are often not the right fit for large clients. But if you’re determined to learn more and become a better professional, that’s the perfect challenge for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solving More Complex Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to adjust to different environments, working with large clients means solving more complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a mom and pop shop is somewhat broken or down, it’s probably not a big deal if their site receives 100 visits per month. But for a project with tens of millions of views a month and thousands of concurrent users, it is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on larger and heavy platforms often means dealing with a lot of data, complex relationships, and solid traffic. This means that every single line of your code and business decision will inevitably impact the entire system in a way visible to hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to cope with these, you should study your specialty in detail and understand what the impact is of every single change. These skills increase your value and let you face similar challenges and solve problems that the majority of beginners can’t even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn a lot about the entire stack, and get to know hundreds of different rules. At some point you will voluntarily violate those rules, being aware of the fact that some design patterns and best practices don’t solve specific problems. It’s better to denormalize a database or minify a compression algorithm in order to solve a business problem for a large platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just as they say at a music college &amp;#8211; you learn the music theory for three years, and then you throw everything away and start playing jazz. You need to know the entire architecture and strategy first in order to decide how to optimize it in the best possible manner, whether it’s using a best practice or violating one for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaming Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have worked solo or in a small team, you will eventually need to partner up or grow. Either way, large projects are time consuming and require different expertise, and it’s unthinkable for one to know it all. Therefore, you will work with other professionals from more industries, team up and solve more complex problems together, and learn more about their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have thought about mastering a single skill, teaming up with the right people will add a few more skills as an extra perk, which will increase the potential of your main skill as well. Working with financial analysts on a project for a bank helped me to understand the entire model of loans and mortgages, as well as the internal banking policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to learn how loans and interests work in different cases and get acquainted with standardized security regulations at companies in the financial field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-44224&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png?resize=688%2C368&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Security Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/8264582@N06/3383392046&quot;&gt;Two Locks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy and security are important topics that people often misjudge. Working with large clients means more responsibility and higher impact in case of a problem. In the process of building a solution or consulting a reputable organization, you will most likely have to comply with various security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of them may seem unnecessary, there is a reason they exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better it is for you, your clients, and future endeavors. If you’re not using VPNs, SSH keys, two-factor authentication, or voice recognition IDS, this may be a good lesson for you. Why are they needed, what problems do they solve, and how can you apply them to your personal data and existing set of clients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization and Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47877&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg?resize=620%2C400&quot; alt=&quot;BrainyQuote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BrainyQuote
&lt;p&gt;In order to be helpful to large businesses as a consultant, or an agency, you need to be reliable. This may be a result of a number of testimonials, successful track record at previous companies or a good portfolio. It’s always challenging to start with large customers, so improving your skills and working hard in order to become valuable is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being organized and process-oriented is essential to most reputable organizations. The majority of them are more conservative and operate slowly, since a minor mistake could cost them millions or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rely on detailed specifications, scope of work documents, use case diagrams, UX mockups/wireframes, E/R diagrams, and a large list of documents. They include every single detail in their planning &amp;#8211; from holidays for each member of their team, to different dependencies from other service providers and third-party members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients have managed to build a process and scale it in a way that grows their revenue in a predictable way. In order to be able to handle large projects, you need to treat them as a small project that takes longer to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use a project management system and version control properly, define your pricing strategy, make sure to predict all of the delays for both communication and payments. Learn how large organizations operate and do your due diligence upfront in order to avoid surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take anything for granted and don’t assume anything. The more confident you are, the higher the possibility of making a major mistake. There are always new automatic deployment strategies or a DevOps service you haven’t heard of, another massive CSS3 grid, or a growth hacking strategy that you haven’t explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more challenges you face, the more you’ll learn, and be able to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Personal WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=21662</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/22/personal-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve forked the FavePersonal theme to release a few changes that I&amp;#8217;ve made to it for my own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improved Gallery feature, including support for WordPress shortcode galleries. If you&amp;#8217;re uploading photos directly to your gallery post, you can use drag and drop to set the order for them now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Post Formats admin UI is now responsive and works great on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the Social plugin from the theme (requested by WP.org) &amp;#8211; it can still be installed separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make tons of misc. code changes to match new coding standards vs. previous coding standards (and pass the theme check).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/maine-gallery-510x469.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gallery&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-22028&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally hoping to have the modified theme hosted on WordPress.org but after weeks of waiting for review, they responded that features of the theme like &lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24520#comment:4&quot;&gt;choosing colors and post formats&lt;/a&gt; should be done in separate plugins instead. This makes no sense to me as these are core features of the theme, but happily there are great places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that will host the project for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Personal theme is quite assuredly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?url=alexking.org&quot;&gt;mobile-friendly&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it a great fit for the importance Google&amp;#8217;s is placing on mobile-friendly sites lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub or, for you technically minded, grab the reop with git. Just make sure to also grab the submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:alexkingorg/wp-personal.git&lt;br /&gt;
cd wp-personal&lt;br /&gt;
git submodule update --init --recursive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/project/personal&quot;&gt;Personal Theme&lt;/a&gt;. View the project timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordCampus a Conference Devoted to Using WordPress in Higher Education</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47853</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordcampus-a-conference-devoted-to-using-wordpress-in-higher-education</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Higher education is a subject that &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.tv/?s=education&quot;&gt;some WordCamps&lt;/a&gt; have tackled over the years, but what if there was an event entirely devoted to it? That&amp;#8217;s the idea &lt;a href=&quot;http://bamadesigner.com&quot;&gt;Rachel Carden&lt;/a&gt; is proposing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;. The idea started off as a tweet but quickly gained momentum with others in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ooh. Dream with me: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampus?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;: A WordCamp for folks using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordPress&lt;/a&gt; in Higher Education.&quot; I like it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/heweb?src=hash&quot;&gt;#heweb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&quot;&gt;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rachel Carden (@bamadesigner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/628324358126235648&quot;&gt;August 3, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCampus is an event that would cover topics such as, how to manage a large-scale network of faculty blogs, abiding by FERPA regulations, or how to best implement single sign-on that integrates with Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carden &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-ed-conference-wordcampus/&quot;&gt;outlines her idea in detail&lt;/a&gt; on Post Status and says that even though camp is in the event&amp;#8217;s name, it doesn&amp;#8217;t imply that it would be an official WordCamp event. She&amp;#8217;s also open to organizing an event not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in speaking, sponsoring, or attending WordCampus, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;fill out the survey &lt;/a&gt;and help spread the word. The more interest Carden generates, the more likely it is that the WordPress Foundation will back the event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: What Do You Want to See in WordPress 4.4?</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47850</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/what-do-you-want-to-see-in-wordpress-4-4</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Scott Taylor, who is &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-team-announces-release-leads-for-wordpress-4-3-and-4-4&quot;&gt;leading the development cycle&lt;/a&gt; for WordPress 4.4, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/19/wordpress-4-4-whats-on-your-wishlist/&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the Make WordPress Core site asking people what they&amp;#8217;d like to see in WordPress 4.4. The post has generated a number of comments from the community. Some of the most popular suggestions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REST API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fields API&lt;/li&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress Foundation Begins Accepting Applications for the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47835</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-begins-accepting-applications-for-the-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KimParsell.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-36619&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KimParsell.png?resize=655%2C418&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp San Francisco 2014 By Sheri Bigelow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordCamp San Francisco 2014 By Sheri Bigelow
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the WordPress Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/&quot;&gt;created a scholarship&lt;/a&gt; in memory of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away&quot;&gt;Kim Parsell&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate her life and contributions to WordPress. With the date and location secured for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/philadelphia-pa-to-host-wordcamp-us-december-4th-6th&quot;&gt;WordCamp US&lt;/a&gt;, applications for the scholarship are now &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/kim-parsell-scholarship-application&quot;&gt;being accepted&lt;/a&gt; by the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the scholarship are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a scholarship for a woman contributor with financial need who has never attended WordCamp San Francisco before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will cover the ticket cost, flight, and lodging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will not cover things like taxis, meals outside the official event, or airport transportation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One scholarship is awarded per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is funded by the WordPress Foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application deadline is September 2, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decision will be made by September 16, 2015, and applicants contacted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the nature of this scholarship &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/&quot;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt;, applicants must fulfill four requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A woman (this includes trans women)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An active contributor to the WordPress open source project (through one of the contributor teams or as a local meetup/WordCamp organizer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone with financial need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone who has never attended WordCamp San Francisco (the precursor to WCUS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim was an older woman who encouraged others, especially women around the same age group to get involved with WordPress. In light of this, older women are highly encouraged to apply for the scholarship if you meet the other requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim once told me that attending WordCamp San Francisco 2014 was one of the best experiences of her life. It was her first WordCamp San Francisco and although she was unemployed at the time, she was able to attend thanks to financial assistance received from the &lt;a title=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to Jen Mylo, the WordPress Foundation, and Matt Mullenweg for not only creating the scholarship, but for providing the opportunity for others to potentially have the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Hybrid Core 3.0 Experiments With Community-driven Documentation</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47825</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/hybrid-core-3-0-experiments-with-community-driven-documentation</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Core 3.0, developed by Justin Tadlock, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://themehybrid.com/weblog/hybrid-core-version-3-0-mr-reynolds&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;. More than a year in the making, 3.0 has over 269 commits and a slew of new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the release of Hybrid Core 2.0 last year, Tadlock assumed it would be at least two years before he tackled another major release, &amp;#8220;I’d planned on doing minor and patch releases for a while, all along building themes,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;However, a lot has changed in the theming world in just the past year. WordPress has added a lot of cool features for theme authors that were previously handled by Hybrid Core,&amp;#8221; Tadlock said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadlock wants the project to feel fresh and one way to do that is to remove features that are handled natively by WordPress. Features removed from Hybrid Core include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atomic hooks functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random Custom Background extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Featured Header extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaner Caption extension (handled in WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop title/description (replaced by WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pagination (replaced by WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s clear that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/&quot;&gt;customizer in WordPress is here to stay&lt;/a&gt; and will be an important part of the project&amp;#8217;s future. Hybrid Core 3.0 adds a variety of enhancements that make the customizer more flexible, these include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color Palette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Checkbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropdown Terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio Image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Select.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a few customizer setting classes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array Map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image Data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tadlock Experiments with Community-driven Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the largest changes to the Hybrid project is opening up documentation to be community-driven. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/wiki&quot;&gt;Hybrid Core wiki&lt;/a&gt; hosted on Github is now open to contributions from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadlock believes that this will drive adoption of the framework by more theme authors, &amp;#8220;The more developers we have using and contributing to the project, the better,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the community responds well to the experiment, it will allow Tadlock to focus on longer-form tutorials for club members, something he feels he&amp;#8217;s better at doing than reference style documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Core 3.0 includes a number of features, bug fixes, and improvements. If you want to see all of the changes in 3.0, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/blob/master/changelog.md&quot;&gt;lengthy changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress 4.3 “Billie” Named After Jazz Singer Billie Holiday Is Available for Download</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47803</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-billie-named-after-jazz-singer-billie-holiday-is-available-for-download</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After four months of development led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://konstantin.obenland.it/&quot;&gt;Konstantin Obenland&lt;/a&gt;, WordPress 4.3 &amp;#8220;Billie&amp;#8221; named after jazz singer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billieholiday.com/&quot;&gt;Billie Holiday&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/billie/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;. This release features menus in the customizer, strong passwords by default, site icons, and variety of other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Menus in the Customizer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now create, add, and edit menus in the customizer while previewing changes to your site in real-time. Unlike other parts of the customizer, previewing menus should be fast as it uses a new hybrid transport layer. Weston Ruter, who contributed to fast previews in the customizer &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/fast-previewing-changes-to-menus-in-the-customizer/&quot;&gt;explains the approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to enable fast previewing of menu changes by default. So we implemented a &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;refresh&lt;/code&gt; hybrid approach which uses &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt; to sync the menus settings to the preview, and then the preview does an Ajax request to render just the contents of the menu container, and this Ajax response is then inserted into the DOM to replace the previous menu container. The technical name for this approach we have been calling &amp;#8216;partial refresh&amp;#8217;, but you can call it fast preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, previewing menus in most themes should be a fast experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/menu-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47806&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/menu-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Menu Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Menu Customizer
&lt;h2&gt;Strong Passwords by Default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Jaquith &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/&quot;&gt;led the effort&lt;/a&gt; to improve the way passwords are chosen and changed in WordPress. On the account management page, clicking the Generate Password button generates a strong password by default. The password strength meter is better integrated into the password field which lets users know immediately when their password is weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/better-passwords.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47807&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/better-passwords.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Better Passwords in WordPress&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Better Passwords in WordPress
&lt;p&gt;The same interface is on the add new user screen, the password reset screen, and the WordPress install screen. While WordPress doesn&amp;#8217;t require users to have a strong password, it does everything it can to encourage users to choose one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, WordPress no longer emails passwords and password reset links expire after 24 hours. When your password or e-mail changes, WordPress sends you an email so if someone hijacks your browser session and changes these items, you’ll be notified that it happened, and you can take action. You can disable these e-mails via the &lt;code&gt;send_pass_change_email&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;send_email_change_email&lt;/code&gt; filters by setting them to false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Icons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icons&lt;/a&gt; are images that represent a website across multiple platforms. You can configure your Site Icon in the Site Identity panel within the customizer where you can upload a 512X512 sized image. This image will be used for browsers, iOS, Android, and Microsoft devices when a visitor bookmarks your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;h2&gt;Text Patterns, Quick Link Toolbar, and Word Count Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editor in WordPress 4.3 has &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/text-patterns-and-the-quick-link-toolbar-in-wordpress-4-3&quot;&gt;undergone more improvements&lt;/a&gt; with text shortcuts, a quick link toolbar, and word count changes. Text patterns or text shortcuts allow you to quickly add unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, and blockquotes without having to use a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When starting a new paragraph with one of these formatting shortcuts followed by a space, the formatting will be applied automatically. Press Backspace or Escape to undo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the visual editor in WordPress 4.3, typing &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and hitting the space bar will generate a bulleted list. Typing &lt;code&gt;1. &lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;1)&lt;/code&gt; and hitting space will generate a numbered list. If you don’t want to create these lists or do so in error, clicking the undo button or hitting &lt;code&gt;ctrl/cmd+z&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt; will undo the text pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a paragraph with two to six number signs &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a heading. Similarly, the greater-than symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;## = H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### = H3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### = H4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;##### = H5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;###### = H6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick Link Preview Toolbar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click a link in the WordPress 4.3 visual editor, a small inline link toolbar displays the full URL with buttons to edit or remove it. This avoids having to use the Insert/edit link modal window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47792&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png?resize=571%2C102&quot; alt=&quot;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3
&lt;p&gt;Word and character counts have also changed in WordPress 4.3. Instead of updating counts when pressing enter or return, it will refresh when you stop typing. A lot more characters that shouldn’t be counted as words are excluded. Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe, WordPress core contributor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/wordcharacter-count-updates-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;lists other notable changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to the Admin Bar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 moves the Customize link to the top-level menu of the admin bar. This link opens the customizer, allowing you to manage menus, appearance, and widgets through the customizer interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46995 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png?resize=429%2C232&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46996 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png?resize=428%2C202&quot; alt=&quot;WP43AdminBar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Admin Bar
&lt;p&gt;The Dashboard, Themes, Widgets, and Menus links take users to their corresponding admin pages in the backend of WordPress. This makes it clear which interface users are about to enter. The enhancement is a result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32678&quot;&gt;ticket #32678&lt;/a&gt; where Helen Hou-Sandí and other WordPress core contributors discussed ways to improve the context of each link over the course of five weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Noteworthy Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-improves-user-search-and-turns-comments-off-on-pages-by-default&quot;&gt;Comments are turned off on pages by default&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/02/deprecating-php4-style-constructors-in-wordpress-4-3/&quot;&gt;PHP-4 Style constructors have been deprecated&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for the release of PHP 7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Singular.php was added to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/06/singular-php-new-theme-template-in-wordpress-4-3/&quot;&gt;WordPress template hierarchy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes to c&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/27/changes-to-customizer-panels-and-sections-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;ustomizer panels and sections.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/31/headings-in-admin-screens-change-in-wordpress-4-3/&quot;&gt;Header tags were updated through the admin screens&lt;/a&gt;. Plugin, theme, and framework developers, please change the main heading from an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; into an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Also, check the rest of your heading structure to ensure it’s semantic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/24/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;Multisite focused changes in 4.3&lt;/a&gt; specifically, the introduction of get_main_network_id()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/30/get_transient-is-now-more-strict-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;get_transient() is now more strict in 4.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The code that powered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/30/legacy-theme-preview-removed-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;old theme preview has been removed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/08/list-table-changes-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;List tables have undergone API and UI changes&lt;/a&gt;, with the introduction of a primary column concept and easier subclassing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 is the result of hundreds of paid and non-paid volunteers working tirelessly to improve the software used on more than 24% of the web. If you experience any issues with WordPress 4.3, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;report them on the support forums&lt;/a&gt;. Volunteers are watching support threads closely and if warranted, will create a thread listing known issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enjoy the full upgrade experience, I encourage you to listen to Lady sings The Blues by Billie Holiday as you upgrade your WordPress sites.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Text Patterns and the Quick Link Toolbar in WordPress 4.3</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47790</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/text-patterns-and-the-quick-link-toolbar-in-wordpress-4-3</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/QuickLinkToolbarFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47794&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/QuickLinkToolbarFeaturedImage.png?resize=675%2C209&quot; alt=&quot;Quick Link Toolbar Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/34547181@N00/4309431757&quot;&gt;metal chain&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 is on schedule to be released &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-3-project-schedule/&quot;&gt;August 18th&lt;/a&gt; and contains a number of improvements. Among the enhancements to the visual editor are text patterns. Text patterns or text shortcuts allow you to quickly add unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, and blockquotes without having to use a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the visual editor in WordPress 4.3, typing &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and hitting the space bar will generate a bulleted list. Typing &lt;code&gt;1. &lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;1)&lt;/code&gt; and hitting space will generate a numbered list. If you don&amp;#8217;t want to create these lists or do so in error, clicking the undo button or hitting &lt;code&gt;ctrl/cmd+z&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt; will undo the text pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a paragraph with two to six number signs &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a heading. Similarly, the greater-than symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;## = H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### = H3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### = H4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;##### = H5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;###### = H6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a few tries to figure out but once I got the hang of it, I discovered that I prefer using text patterns versus clicking the appropriate button in the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the blockquote text pattern places text into a blockquote and automatically closes it while also starting a new paragraph. Traditionally, I highlight text and click on the blockquote button in the editor. Often times, I have to visit the text editor and close the blockquote to start a new paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Boren, WordPress core lead developer, created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/01/editor-enhancements-in-4-3-%E2%9C%A8/&quot;&gt;following video&lt;/a&gt; which shows the text patterns in action on a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Previews of Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.2 included a subtle but convenient feature for adding links to text. Pasting the URL to highlighted text automatically turns it into a link. The problem is that there isn&amp;#8217;t an easy way to preview the URL without opening it in a new browser tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click a link in the WordPress 4.3 visual editor, a small inline link toolbar displays the full URL with buttons to edit or remove it. This avoids having to use the Insert/edit link modal window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47792&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png?resize=571%2C102&quot; alt=&quot;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preview Links in The WordPress 4.3 Visual Editor
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to Word and Character Counts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word and character counts have also changed in WordPress 4.3. Instead of updating counts when pressing enter or return, it will refresh when you stop typing. A lot more characters that shouldn&amp;#8217;t be counted as words are excluded. Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe, WordPress core contributor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/wordcharacter-count-updates-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;lists other notable changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;character&lt;/strong&gt; count, we no longer exclude any of these characters. This means that numbers and common western punctuation are no longer excluded compared to 4.2. Emoji and other astral characters are now counted as one character instead of two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a new type &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt;, in addition to words and characters, that will count characters including spaces. This seemed necessary for Japanese and maybe other languages. This is now &lt;code&gt;character_including_spaces&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;character_excluding_spaces&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcodes and HTML comments are now excluded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view details and a summary of all the work that went into improving word counts, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30966&quot;&gt;ticket #30966&lt;/a&gt; on trac. As someone who uses the WordPress content editor for a living, I&amp;#8217;m anxiously looking forward to utilizing these enhancements on an everyday basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: A WordPress conference for higher education: coming to a campus near you?</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14001</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-ed-conference-wordcampus/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Thus far, there have been numerous niche WordPress conferences aiming toward for-profit initiatives and geared toward businesses, marketers, or eCommerce site owners. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://bamadesigner.com/&quot;&gt;Rachel Carden&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s concept for a niche, education focused, non-profit event is unique and I&amp;#8217;d love to see it happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As she notes, universities have unique challenges for managing websites and are also great candidates for utilizing WordPress to its full potential. What follows is her pitch and public brainstorming session on what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org/&quot;&gt;higher education focused WordPress conference&lt;/a&gt; might look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started with a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ooh. Dream with me: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampus?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;: A WordCamp for folks using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordPress&lt;/a&gt; in Higher Education.&quot; I like it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/heweb?src=hash&quot;&gt;#heweb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&quot;&gt;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rachel Carden (@bamadesigner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/628324358126235648&quot;&gt;August 3, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCamp U.S. made a big announcement that was all over Twitter, Chris Lema tweeted what we were all thinking, and I couldn’t help but start daydreaming about the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I’m a web designer and developer with a passion for all things WordPress, especially using WordPress to build the world of higher ed web. Having spent the last 8 years working in higher education, I’m always looking for ways to utilize the power of WordPress to fulfill my campus’s needs and to help its communication grow, whether it’s using the powerful CMS to stretch limited resources or using its new API capabilities to share information, and break down silos, across campus departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love attending WordCamps and other WordPress-related events, but the issues we generally encounter in higher ed are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like online businesses or blogging, higher ed is a world of its own with unique challenges, content, stakeholders, and target audiences. In our world, we don’t worry so much about which eCommerce plugin is best. Instead, we’re more concerned with things like how to manage a large-scale network of faculty blogs, making sure we’re abiding with FERPA regulations, or wondering how to best implement single sign-on that integrates with Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m proposing a new event in the WordPress community: a conference focused on using WordPress in the world of higher education. I call the idea “WordCampus”. (Kind of a perfect name, right? How did nobody think of this before?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name “WordCampus” came to me from a tweet and does not, at this point, imply it would be an official WordCamp event. If needed, I’m open to organizing an event that is not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation. This is a detail that remains to be seen, but honestly, at this point, all details remain to be seen. A WordCamp representative has confirmed that a user group specific WordCamp is possible, but I would need to prove that it could draw a crowd. That’s why I need your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a WordPress conference for higher ed is something you would be interested in (whether it’s as an attendee, speaker, planner, sponsor, or all of the above), I invite you to read a few of my thoughts, share yours in the comments, and visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org/&quot;&gt;wordcampus.org&lt;/a&gt; to show your support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cost and fee consideration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like your usual WordCamp, the goal for this event is to keep the costs and ticket price as low as possible. The point of this event is professional development and community, not profit. The phrases “big budget” and “higher ed” don’t generally appear in the same sentence anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of higher ed-oriented web conferences can run upwards of $500 so an inexpensive, but valuable, event would be attractive for most higher education web professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unique sponsorship opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having sponsors to help with costs would be crucial and I am open to all kinds of support, whether it’s monetary or in-kind. Sponsoring an event like WordCampus would be a unique way to get an organization’s name in front of one of the best communities &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of WordPress that &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; WordPress all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of higher education, you often have limited resources, so there are plenty of opportunities for third party products or services like hosting, themes, plugins, custom design, accessibility consulting, and custom development, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Location is a factor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location could be a sticking point, as high travel costs might be a deal breaker for many WordCampus attendees. The beauty of local WordCamps is that they are tied to a geographical region and therefore, for most attendees, have limited travel requirements. This could be a problem for an event that is not tied to a specific region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue wise, universities have beautiful facilities, so I’d love to host the event on an actual college campus and, if the hosting university could donate the space in kind, this would be a huge cost saver. The most preferable universities would also be located near a major airport to help reduce travel time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m really dreaming big, it would be great to find numerous universities that would be willing to host and, therefore, we could have regional WordCampus events spread across the country. I don’t think this is outside the realm of possibility, but would depend on interest and attendance. I&amp;#8217;m certainly interested in hearing from anyone that may be interested in hosting WordCampus at their university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A big target audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a wide variety of WordPress users in higher ed, from the university-level WordPress developers and administrators, to the users who run WordPress for a college, to the faculty members using WordPress as a learning tool, and any students who’d love to learn a thing or two (they are our future, you know). That’s not even including content strategists, designers, social media managers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCampus has the potential to attract a variety of users who could inspire a multitude of topics and professional development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A broad variety of topics, even within the education umbrella&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of topics, these could also run the gamut from higher ed marketing and content strategy to infrastructure, managing multi-author blogs, and streamlining application processes. Accessibility should also be a featured topic as federally funded institutions are required by law to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I see the structure of higher ed as tailor-made for the open source mindset and would love to hear someone encourage collaboration and openness by comparing the ideologies of open source with the inner workings of higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Event timing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As organizing something of this magnitude takes time, I’m looking at a 2016 booking. What time of the year in 2016, however, remains to be seen. There are obviously a lot of variables at play, from venue availability to which time of the year is best for our target attendees. In higher ed, you need time to clear your schedule and request funding, so I’d want to allow for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the middle of the semester is best for most higher ed professionals, but this can vary depending on their field. And if we’re being honest, the majority of fall might be out of the question because of football season. We’ve included a straw poll &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org&quot;&gt;on the event landing page&lt;/a&gt; to help us gauge which time of year might be best for those interested in attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read through my proposal and hopefully interested parties will have a few additional thoughts for the comments. If you would like be notified of any future developments, or show your support for the project, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org&quot;&gt;wordcampus.org&lt;/a&gt; to share a little bit of information. And don’t forget to tell your friends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, or would like to chat, you can also find me on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner&quot;&gt;@bamadesigner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WP REST API 1.2.3 Patches XSS Vulnerability</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47770</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-1-2-3-patches-xss-vulnerability</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WP REST API version 1.2.3 and 2.0 Beta 4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/14/rest-api-v1-2-3-and-v2-0-b4/&quot;&gt;address a security issue&lt;/a&gt; that affects sites running 1.2 or 2.0 beta. This release fixes a potential XSS vulnerability related to JSONP support in 1.2 and 2.0 of the API. Automatic updates are in progress for 1.2.3 but if your site hasn&amp;#8217;t automatically updated, the team suggests updating manually as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the security release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/&quot;&gt;2.0 Beta 4&lt;/a&gt; includes a number of enhancements, some of which break backwards compatibility. Developers and beta testers should read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/releases/tag/2.0-beta4&quot;&gt;detailed changelog&lt;/a&gt; and release notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Nick Haskins Rebrands Lasso to Editus</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47763</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/nick-haskins-rebrands-lasso-to-editus</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In mid July, Nick Haskins, founder and lead developer of Lasso, was served a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/nick-haskins-receives-cease-and-desist-letter-for-violating-lassosoft-trademarks&quot;&gt;cease and desist letter&lt;/a&gt; from LassoSoft. LassoSoft argued that Lasso violates its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=861046116&quot;&gt;registered trademarks&lt;/a&gt; and causes confusion to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EdiusFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-47764&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EdiusFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C182&quot; alt=&quot;Edit us Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Instead of fighting litigation, Haskins decided to rebrand the product from Lasso to&lt;a href=&quot;https://edituswp.com/lasso-is-now-editus/&quot;&gt; Editus.&lt;/a&gt; The name was suggested by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iklektive.com/&quot;&gt;Gavin Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;. According to Haskins, the only references to the name is a band in Costa Rica and a directory in Luxemburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a new domain and cloned website, Lasso 0.9.8 is available for download which includes the renaming of various admin menu items that used the term Lasso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lasso 0.9.8 Requires a Manual Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haskins says users will need to update to 0.9.8 manually because of the switch in domain names but automatic updates will return after 0.9.8,  &amp;#8220;Updates after 0.9.8, will continue to be automatic, just as the way they were before,&amp;#8221; Haskins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesopinteractive LLC is &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickhaskins.com/2015/07/on-life-and-family/&quot;&gt;looking for a buyer&lt;/a&gt; but after receiving low offers, Haskins has decided to use a broker to facilitate the sale. The broker requested that the rebrand of Lasso be completed before proceeding with the sale process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Editus has a nice ring to it, what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile web and mobile in-app behaviour are not binary. When users are in the facebook app, they spend a tremendous amount of time accessing the mobile web through facebook’s own in-app browser. The same for twitter and others. We enter social apps for discovery and then access the mobile web while still in-app. It is a mistake to conflate time spent on the mobile web with time spent in a traditional browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 Adds Statistical Insights</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47740</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-version-5-4-adds-statistical-insights</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=&amp;ct=&quot;&gt;available on the app store&lt;/a&gt; and includes a couple of new features. To compliment the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-5-3-released-with-refreshed-stats-and-a-new-layout-for-posts-and-pages&quot;&gt;improvements to stats in 5.3&lt;/a&gt;, 5.4 adds a new stats screen called insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insights is similar to the Right Now widget in the WordPress dashboard in that it displays a summary of key statistics for a site including, total number of published posts, views, visitors, and the best traffic day. There&amp;#8217;s also a section that displays the current day&amp;#8217;s stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_7433.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47744&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_7433.png?resize=282%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Stat Insights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stat Insights
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 5.4, you could only add images to posts that were stored on the device. WordPress for iOS 5.4 adds the ability to insert images from the WordPress media library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add an image from the WordPress media library, select media library from the menu at the top of the screen. If you have a lot of items in the media library, it may take a few minutes to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WPiPhoneMediaLibrary.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-47746&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WPiPhoneMediaLibrary.png?resize=500%2C399&quot; alt=&quot;WP For iOS 5.4 Media Library Selection&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other improvements include the ability to search the My Sites list and viewing embedded images in comments. This makes it easier to see the full context of a comment without having to view it in a different part of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the team fixed a bug that caused the app to not restore its state properly. WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=&amp;ct=&quot;&gt;free and available&lt;/a&gt; on the app store. If you encounter any issues, you&amp;#8217;re encouraged to report them on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ios.forums.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress for iOS support forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Short Interview With Nikolay Bachiyski WordPress’ Security Czar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47728</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/short-interview-with-nikolay-bachiyski-wordpress-security-czar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While on stage at &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Europe&lt;/a&gt; answering a question related to WordPress’ security track record, Matt Mullenweg named &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/nbachiyski&quot;&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski&lt;/a&gt; as the first Security Czar for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Bachiyski to learn why the role was created and what its purpose is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the responsibilities of your new role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responsibilities are to coordinate the security efforts of&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;mostly with incident response and to make sure we respond quickly, have solid fixes, and make sure everyone involved is informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What circumstances led to this role&amp;#8217;s creation?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing too spicy around the creation of the role. As the volume of requests increased, we realized a bit more structure would be helpful so that we are more focused and use our resources wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you only handle security issues for the open source project or will you also help with Automattic’s bounty program as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other colleagues at Automattic who are responsible for the bounty program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are the connections and trust you’ve established over the last 11 years to your role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offline relationships are very important in an online community and I am lucky to know many of the members of the security team in person. This definitely makes working with them easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn More About the WordPress Security Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;d like to learn more about who&amp;#8217;s on the WordPress security team, what they do, and how they handle security releases, listen to my interview with Gary Pendergast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pendergast who works for Automattic, is a WordPress core contributor, and a member of the WordPress core security team. In the interview, we discuss what happened behind the scenes before &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/plugin-developers-demand-a-better-security-release-process-after-wordpress-4-2-3-breaks-thousands-of-websites&quot;&gt;4.2.3 was released&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Avis GPS</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45255</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/08/avis-gps/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After an amazing WordCamp Scranton on Saturday I was heading to a friend&amp;#8217;s birthday on Long Island on Sunday, a few people were surprised I had flown from New York and said driving took about the same amount of time when you factor in all the airport hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Google Mapped it and it did look like it was only 5-6 hours from Scranton to where I was going. Being a born and raised Texan, I love a good drive, and I probably haven&amp;#8217;t had a proper road trip since my sister&amp;#8217;s birthday a few years ago when we went up Highway 1. I&amp;#8217;ve also never driven on the East Coast, and it seemed like there were some really pretty parks and lakes in between Scranton and Long Island so I ended up going to the airport anyway because that&amp;#8217;s where the rental cars were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avis.com/&quot;&gt;Avis&lt;/a&gt;. They try harder. &lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/s.ma.tt/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=604&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt; One thing they do that&amp;#8217;s pretty cool is sell  decent cables, USB wall chargers, and car chargers for a cheap price right at the check-in desk. (I always carry my own car charger, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Incase-Speed-Charger-Lightning-Cable/dp/B00P7Y6M2Y/&quot;&gt;this is my current pick&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s super-handy in Ubers as well.) Amazingly though they still try to give you one of those Garmin GPS units that&amp;#8217;s worse than your smartphone in every possible way. I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s a money maker, otherwise the only reasonable thing to do would be provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O5JARCI&quot;&gt;a smartphone mount&lt;/a&gt; (or have one already set up in the car) rather than saddling people with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/559938/ref=zg_b_bs_559938_1&quot;&gt;archaic, non-networked navigation device&lt;/a&gt; that has no idea about construction or traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up going to a Walmart that was nearby to pick up a car mount (price, $12) that ended up being a life-saver for the trip. &lt;strong&gt;I also believe that every person in tech should visit Walmart at least once a year, and spend time in their technology section.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s good to understand and see how people who don&amp;#8217;t live for technology every day interact with it. It&amp;#8217;s eye-opening, and it&amp;#8217;s handy to know what&amp;#8217;s in stock in case you need 50 feet of ethernet at 4 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping the car off in Manhattan, it looks like they charged me $20 for a GPS which I don&amp;#8217;t even have, so now going to need to sort out both the fee and the &amp;#8220;missing&amp;#8221; GPS system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl; dr: Smart car rental companies should ditch the GPS, provide smartphone mounts instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Organizing Team Explains Why Philadelphia Should Host WordCamp US</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47699</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/organizing-team-explains-why-philadelphia-should-host-wordcamp-us</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When organizing teams in different &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2015-now-accepting-applications-for-host-city&quot;&gt;cities applied to host&lt;/a&gt; WordCamp US earlier this year, they provided a substantial amount of information through the application process. While &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/philadelphia-pa-to-host-wordcamp-us-december-4th-6th&quot;&gt;Philadelphia will host&lt;/a&gt; the event in 2015 and 2016, their application is not public information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juliana Reyes, who writes for &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly&quot;&gt;Technical.ly Philly&lt;/a&gt;, acquired and &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly/2015/08/11/wordcamp-us-philadelphia-wordpress-devs/&quot;&gt;published a few&lt;/a&gt; of the responses from the organizing team&amp;#8217;s application, specifically questions four, nine, ten, and eleven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question nine on the application asks, why do you think your city should host WordCamp US 2015? The organizing team responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Philadelphia is the birthplace of our nation. The United States started here, and so should WordCamp US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’re ideally situated on the East Coast between New York and Washington DC, and the halfway point between the West Coast and parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With a population of 1.5 million, it is the 5th largest city in North America, and is a cultural hub for all things food, music, art, and technology. It is well-known for its many excellent medical and educational facilities, including the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Drexel University, and the University of the Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With over 1,200 daily inbound and outbound flights, Philadelphia is easy to reach from anywhere in the world. The average hotel room and cost of living, is far below any other major East Coast city, and nowhere else has cheesesteaks like we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve yet to visit Philadelphia but one thing I&amp;#8217;ve learned is that residents take their reputation for cheesesteaks seriously. Be sure to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly/2015/08/11/wordcamp-us-philadelphia-wordpress-devs/&quot;&gt;the post&lt;/a&gt; to see the team&amp;#8217;s responses to the other three questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: ThemeConf a Conference for Front-End Developers and Designers September 2nd-4th, 2015</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47686</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/themeconf-a-conference-for-front-end-developers-and-designers-september-2nd-4th-2015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ThemeConfLogo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-47688&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ThemeConfLogo.png?resize=215%2C181&quot; alt=&quot;ThemeConf Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://themeconf.com/&quot;&gt;ThemeConf&lt;/a&gt; is a new conference set to take place September 2nd-4th, 2015, in Keswick, England aimed at front-end developers and designers. Confirmed speakers include a handful of Automattic theme wranglers, Noel Tock of Human Made, freelancer Adam Onishi, and Chris Hutchinson of The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session schedule is expected to be released later this week however, here are some of the topics that will be covered at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Craft, workflow and best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser performance and developer tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and photography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript and REST APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Lenox and Tammie Lister, who are the primary organizers of the event, originally came up with the idea for ThemeConf at the Automattic UK Christmas dinner, &amp;#8220;Lenox wanted to bring a conference to where he lives in the Lake district and I wanted to do one focusing on themes,&amp;#8221; Lister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two have been planning the event since January of this year. Although most of the confirmed speakers work with WordPress, ThemeConf is not dedicated to it, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s geared to those making themes in general and working on the front end. We have tried hard not to focus on WordPress,&amp;#8221; Lister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.to/themeconf/2015&quot;&gt;Tickets for ThemeConf&lt;/a&gt; are £49 and £99 respectively. The £49 tickets are for speaker sessions only while the £99 tickets include access to a workshop on using the REST API and lunch. Accommodations in the Lake District two hours from Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Liverpool and Leeds are available through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keswick.org/&quot;&gt;Keswick.org.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Surpasses One Billion Total Downloads</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47673</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-surpasses-one-billion-total-downloads</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The WordPress project achieved a milestone earlier today as the official WordPress plugin directory &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/&quot;&gt;surpassed one billion&lt;/a&gt; total downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1billiondownloads.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47674&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1billiondownloads.png?resize=944%2C312&quot; alt=&quot;One billion total plugin downloads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;More than one billion total downloads
&lt;p&gt;According to Scott Reilly who helps maintain WordPress.org, we&amp;#8217;ll never know which plugin generated the one billionth download. That&amp;#8217;s because WordPress.org doesn&amp;#8217;t log information that matches downloads to plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A download counter exists for each plugin for each day and the total amount is the summation of all those daily download counts,&amp;#8221; Reilly said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As WordPress&amp;#8217; &lt;a href=&quot;http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all&quot;&gt;market share&lt;/a&gt; continues to grow, so does the amount of downloads from the plugin directory. The following numbers are the total amount of downloads from March 2006 to August 2015. This year, the directory is on pace to serve more than 300 million downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 2006  191,567&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2007  2,845,802&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2008  15,130,856&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2009  49,822,116&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2010  72,342,598&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2011  108,501,907&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2012  141,609,682&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2013  182,236,517&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014  241,142,505&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 2015 to August 2015  186,243,700&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took nine years for the plugin directory to reach one billion downloads, when do you think it will reach two billion?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The cottage can hold up to 15 people where attendees can ski, discuss WordPress, develop code, or disconnect from technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;Bernard-Jacquet&lt;/a&gt; who writes for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-spread.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WP-spread&lt;/a&gt;, and helps organize the local WordPress meetup in Grenoble, France, is organizing the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooms at the cottage cost 350 euros. This amount covers the room for a week plus dinner at two restaurants. Prepare to bring some extra cash as the bus, skipass, and ski rental are additional costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s not an official deadline to book a room but the sooner you book the better. If you&amp;#8217;re interested in booking a room, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;contact Berard-Jacquet&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible so he can make arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Richard Best Publishes Human Readable Version of the GPLv2 License</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47645</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/richard-best-publishes-human-readable-version-of-the-gplv2-license</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is licensed under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/&quot;&gt;GPLv2&lt;/a&gt; and the four freedoms it allows is considered to be its &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/&quot;&gt;Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt;. The four freedoms are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to benefit from your changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more to the GPL than the four freedoms listed above however, the license details can be difficult to read and decipher. Richard Best, a qualified lawyer in New Zealand, England, and Wales, has published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpandlegalstuff.com/a-human-readable-summary-of-the-gpl/&quot;&gt;human readable summary&lt;/a&gt; of the GPL license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by how Creative Commons offers a &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot;&gt;human readable version&lt;/a&gt; of its licenses, the summary explains the core concepts of the GPL and outlines the position in relation to copying, distribution, fees, modifications/derivative works, distributing non-source forms, termination, and downstream licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to note that the document is not endorsed by the Free Software Foundation nor a substitute for the full license text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GPLSummarySample2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47647&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GPLSummarySample2.png?resize=705%2C554&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of the human readable summary of the GPL&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sample of the human readable summary of the GPL
&lt;p&gt;I encourage everyone participating in the WordPress ecosystem to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/&quot;&gt;full license&lt;/a&gt; text at least once. However, the summary does a good job explaining the core components of the GPL without having to dig into the license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions concerning the GPL, I suggest seeking legal council with a lawyer familiar with software licensing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress Core Team Receives Praise for Their Efforts to Maintain Security</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47619</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-core-team-receives-praise-for-their-efforts-to-maintain-security</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Netanel Rubin, a vulnerability researcher for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.checkpoint.com/&quot;&gt;Check Point Software&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/&quot;&gt;credited&lt;/a&gt; for properly disclosing a security vulnerability to WordPress, published the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/08/04/wordpress-vulnerabilities-1/&quot;&gt;first in a trilogy of posts&lt;/a&gt; that explains how he discovered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability was discovered during a full audit of WordPress&amp;#8217; code base in which Rubin praised the efforts of the WordPress development team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to these frequent findings in 3rd party plug-ins’ code, barebones WordPress issues are rare, as WordPress core developers are well-trained to hold high security awareness for all released code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can confirm that during our audit of the source code, we witnessed the developers ‘leaving nothing to chance’, and implementing multiple layers of security protecting most attack vectors we could think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress developers deserve praise for their efforts to maintain such complex software in this level of security, specifically considering the presence of the notoriously trigger-happy foot-gun called PHP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/08/04/wordpress-vulnerabilities-1/&quot;&gt;reading the post&lt;/a&gt; as it&amp;#8217;s a brief look into the mind of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat&quot;&gt;white hat&lt;/a&gt; security researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although WordPress has &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-4-patches-six-security-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;seen its fair share&lt;/a&gt; of security related releases this year, it&amp;#8217;s reassuring to hear a third-party whose job it is to penetrate software security praise WordPress&amp;#8217; codebase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The Mantra of Family Comes First</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47609</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-mantra-of-family-comes-first</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FamilyFirstFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47611&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FamilyFirstFeaturedImage.png?resize=669%2C247&quot; alt=&quot;Family First Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/63122283@N06/11867028263&quot;&gt;Mama&amp;#8217;s &lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/recap-of-prestige-a-conference-geared-towards-growing-businesses&quot;&gt;Prestige over the weekend&lt;/a&gt;, I heard a presenter say that family comes first. This isn&amp;#8217;t the first time I&amp;#8217;ve heard this advice but it&amp;#8217;s becoming more prevalent. I generally hear this advice from those who are living comfortably, have two kids or more, and/or have gone through the startup process more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a distributed worker who receives a check every two weeks. I&amp;#8217;m married, have no kids, and write about WordPress for a living. Putting family first should be easy but it&amp;#8217;s not. The last two years as a distributed worker, I&amp;#8217;ve put work before family unless it&amp;#8217;s an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, my wife and I had a serious conversation about the way I work and how it has negatively impacted our marriage. I&amp;#8217;m a late owl and on most nights, my wife sleeps alone. As a distributed worker, I get to make the rules and put myself in the best environment to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation with my wife involved words not fit for reproduction but everything she said was right. I&amp;#8217;m spending too much time on digital devices and not enough with her. Our conversation was the wake up call I didn&amp;#8217;t know I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not easy putting family first all the time. Some argue that you need to put yourself before family so that you can provide for them. Others find a critical balance between spending time with family and getting the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you put family first when there are bills that need to be paid, sites to be built, and a constant deluge of work to be done? Please share your thoughts, experiences, and advice in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress 4.2.4 Patches Six Security Vulnerabilities</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47605</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-4-patches-six-security-vulnerabilities</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/&quot;&gt;4.2.4 is available&lt;/a&gt; and patches six security vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities were discovered by outside parties and members of the WordPress core security team. This release also fixes four bugs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WPDB: When checking the encoding of strings against the database, make sure we&amp;#8217;re only relying on the return value of strings that were sent to the database. &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32279&quot;&gt;#32279&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t blindly trust the output of &lt;tt&gt;glob()&lt;/tt&gt; to be an array. &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33093&quot;&gt;#33093&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcodes: Handle &lt;tt&gt;do_shortcode('&amp;lt;[shortcode]')&lt;/tt&gt; edge cases. &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33116&quot;&gt;#33116&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcodes: Protect newlines inside of &lt;tt&gt;CDATA&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33106&quot;&gt;#33106&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a busy year for the WordPress security team. Since the beginning of the year, there has been five security releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-1-2/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.1.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.2.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/05/wordpress-4-2-2/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.2.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-2-3/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.2.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.2.4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users should check their sites to make sure they&amp;#8217;re running 4.2.4. If your site hasn&amp;#8217;t automatically updated yet, you should perform a full backup and manually update. Sites running WordPress RC 2 are safe since it fixes the same issues as 4.2.4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Recap of Prestige a Conference Geared Towards Growing Businesses</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47580</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/recap-of-prestige-a-conference-geared-towards-growing-businesses</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PrestigeconfFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47595&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PrestigeconfFeaturedImage.png?resize=677%2C268&quot; alt=&quot;Tony Perez of Sucuri&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tony Perez of Sucuri Presenting on Security at Prestige
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I attended &lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige&lt;/a&gt;, a conference geared towards freelancers, entrepreneurs, and small agencies looking to grow their businesses. Unlike WordCamps, plugins, themes, and WordPress in general were rarely mentioned. Instead, sessions included high level topics such as, how to land enterprise clients, knowing when to move on to the next big thing, and the benefits of partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue was perfect with plenty of space and the WiFi worked well. Lunch was an hour-long and provided on both days. The lunchroom can easily seat 300 people or more. Only a third of the space was used when attendees ate lunch providing a great environment to network with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nancy Lyons and Technology&amp;#8217;s Dirty Little Secret&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don&amp;#8217;t deal with clients or own an agency, many of the sessions at Prestige are non-applicable to my day job. However, there is one session in particular that resonated with me. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nancylyons.com/&quot;&gt;Nancy Lyons&lt;/a&gt;, founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clockwork.net/&quot;&gt;Clockwork&lt;/a&gt;, shared her philosophies on hiring and getting employees engaged. Happy employees do good work but what makes them happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autonomy:  Control over time, technique, team, or task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastery: Make progress and get better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purpose: Be part of something bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the tips shared by Lyons are geared towards employers but they&amp;#8217;re just as applicable to employees. The biggest danger to agencies and freelancers is the inability to have conversations with clients about what is and isn&amp;#8217;t possible. According to Lyons, you can love someone and still tell them what they need to hear. One of the best tips she shared is to find and have fun at work as there&amp;#8217;s nothing wrong with having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Behind the Scenes of the Livestream&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prestige is &lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/free-livestream-minneapolis-2015/&quot;&gt;known for having&lt;/a&gt; a high quality livestream where more than 1,000 people can watch the conference live. The livestream is produced by &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixpromedia.com/&quot;&gt;PixProMedia&lt;/a&gt;. The gentleman in charge uses a TriCaster to switch between speakers and slides during sessions. Here are a couple of photographs of his equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/recap-of-prestige-a-conference-geared-towards-growing-businesses#gallery-47580-1-slideshow&quot;&gt;Click to view slideshow.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to some viewers, watching the livestream was like being at the conference but is not a substitute for face-to-face interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffr0&quot;&gt;@jeffr0&lt;/a&gt; The learning is like being there.  I miss the handshakes in the hallway, meeting people face-to-face.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/prestigeconf?src=hash&quot;&gt;#prestigeconf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cate DeRosia (@mysweetcate) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mysweetcate/status/627924263799009280&quot;&gt;August 2, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Westwerk Is a Great Venue for After Parties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The after party was held at &lt;a href=&quot;http://westwerk.com/&quot;&gt;Westwerk&lt;/a&gt;, a WordPress development agency and primary sponsor of the event. Their office was perfect for an after party as it includes, a foosball table, Nintendo Wii, shuffleboard, drinks, pool table, and small offices for private conversations. It&amp;#8217;s one of the best after parties for a conference that I&amp;#8217;ve attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prestige is Serious Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem like a WordPress conference on the surface but Prestige is geared towards business minded people. It&amp;#8217;s highly focused and filled with information you can apply to companies in and outside of WordPress. If you want to learn how to take your business to the next level, Prestige is an excellent value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: How to Avoid This Embarrassing Sharing Bug on WordPress.com</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47476</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/how-to-avoid-embarrassing-sharing-bug-on-wordpress-com</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you use the sharing feature on WordPress.com, you may have noticed an anomaly between your post title and what&amp;#8217;s shared to social services. Since the post title is the first field to complete when writing a post, it makes sense to fill it in even if it&amp;#8217;s a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharing module on WordPress.com has a bug where the initial text in a post title is used when sharing the post to social networks. For the past several months, I&amp;#8217;ve published many articles on WordPress.com where the text within social links does not match the text used in the post title leaving me feeling embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BuginAction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47477&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BuginAction.png?resize=728%2C482&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress.com Bug in Action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress.com Bug in Action
&lt;p&gt;To avoid this embarrassment, you&amp;#8217;ll need to alter the text used in the sharing module before publishing each post. If you&amp;#8217;re using the New Dash interface on WordPress.com, locate the Sharing metabox as seen in the screenshot above. When you&amp;#8217;re ready to hit the publish button, change the text to match your title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/TheCorrectPostTitle.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47478&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/TheCorrectPostTitle.png?resize=571%2C462&quot; alt=&quot;Post Title Matches the Sharing Text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Post Title Matches the Sharing Text
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spoken to several Automattic employees at various WordPress events and they&amp;#8217;re aware of the bug. Until it&amp;#8217;s fixed, you&amp;#8217;ll need to remember to change the sharing text before you publish a post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>

It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Site icons for all</em><br />
<em>Live preview menu changes</em><br />
<em>Four three beta now</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.2 is now available. This is a <strong>critical security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>Version 4.2.2 addresses two security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Genericons icon font package, which is used in a number of popular themes and plugins, contained an HTML file vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. All affected themes and plugins hosted on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> (including the Twenty Fifteen default theme) have been updated today by the WordPress security team to address this issue by removing this nonessential file. To help protect other Genericons usage, WordPress 4.2.2 proactively scans the wp-content directory for this HTML file and removes it. Reported by Robert Abela of <a href="http://netsparker.com">Netsparker</a>.</li>
<li>WordPress versions 4.2 and earlier are affected by a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/">critical cross-site scripting vulnerability</a>, which could enable anonymous users to compromise a site. WordPress 4.2.2 includes a comprehensive fix for this issue. Reported separately by Rice Adu and Tong Shi from Baidu[X-team].</li>
</ul>
<p>The release also includes hardening for a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability when using the visual editor. This issue was reported by Mahadev Subedi.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.2 also contains fixes for 13 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.2">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=32418&amp;stop_rev=32324">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.2</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.2.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.2:</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.3 make it even easier to format your content and customize your site.</p>
<p><iframe width='692' height='389' src='https://videopress.com/embed/T54Iy7Tw?hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1435166243'></script></p>
<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>

&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.3:</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Site icons for all</em><br />
<em>Live preview menu changes</em><br />
<em>Four three beta now</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.2 is now available. This is a <strong>critical security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>Version 4.2.2 addresses two security issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Genericons icon font package, which is used in a number of popular themes and plugins, contained an HTML file vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. All affected themes and plugins hosted on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> (including the Twenty Fifteen default theme) have been updated today by the WordPress security team to address this issue by removing this nonessential file. To help protect other Genericons usage, WordPress 4.2.2 proactively scans the wp-content directory for this HTML file and removes it. Reported by Robert Abela of <a href="http://netsparker.com">Netsparker</a>.</li>
<li>WordPress versions 4.2 and earlier are affected by a <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/">critical cross-site scripting vulnerability</a>, which could enable anonymous users to compromise a site. WordPress 4.2.2 includes a comprehensive fix for this issue. Reported separately by Rice Adu and Tong Shi from Baidu[X-team].</li>
</ul>
<p>The release also includes hardening for a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability when using the visual editor. This issue was reported by Mahadev Subedi.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.2 also contains fixes for 13 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.2">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=32418&amp;stop_rev=32324">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.2</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.2.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.2:</p>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress.com Unveils the Action Bar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47954</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-unveils-the-action-bar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/new-action-bar/&quot;&gt;unveiled a new user interface&lt;/a&gt; called the Action Bar. It&amp;#8217;s a bar that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen for logged in users and is accessible from any device. The bar performs multiple tasks depending on the page you&amp;#8217;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47955&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png?resize=1025%2C627&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Action Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress Action Bar
&lt;p&gt;When on a WordPress.com powered site that you&amp;#8217;re not following, the bar turns into a Follow button. Clicking the follow button will notify you of new posts published on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47956&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png?resize=192%2C60&quot; alt=&quot;Action Bar Follow Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Action Bar Follow Button
&lt;p&gt;If you click the three dots to the right, you&amp;#8217;ll see a variety of options depending upon the page you&amp;#8217;re viewing. If it&amp;#8217;s the homepage, you&amp;#8217;ll see links to download the theme the site uses, report the content, or manage the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re browsing a specific post on a WordPress.com site, you&amp;#8217;ll see an additional link to copy a shortlink for quick and easy sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com and are logged in, the Follow button turns into a Customize button. This link provides a quick way to enter the Customizer. There&amp;#8217;s also an Edit link if you&amp;#8217;re browsing a published post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47958&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png?resize=307%2C348&quot; alt=&quot;Edit and Customize Links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Edit and Customize Links
&lt;p&gt;If the action bar is too big and you want to minimize it, click the three dots and select the option to Collapse the bar. It will shrink the bar into squares and get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the action bar is the ability to quickly see and download a theme used on a WordPress.com site. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for WordPress.com specific sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailypost.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The Daily Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What annoys me about the action bar is that it disappears when I scroll down. I caught myself scrolling down to read a post and when I looked for the edit button to fix a typo, the action bar was gone. I think it should stay on the screen at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to see the Edit link in the action bar open a front-end editor. It&amp;#8217;s time WordPress.com step up its game and stop forcing users through a backend interface to edit published content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the experimental action bar but at the same time, I question the reasoning for adding yet another user interface element to mimic actions already supported by other buttons and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, between the admin bar, dashboard, the edit link underneath a post, and the action bar, there are now four different ways to edit a post. How many roads are necessary to reach the same destination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com, let me know what you think of the action bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.3.3 Patches Security Vulnerabilities in BuddyPress Messages Component</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47948</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-3-3-patches-security-vulnerabilities-in-buddypress-messages-component</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-41978&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BuddyPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=828%2C265&quot; alt=&quot;BuddyPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3&lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2015/08/buddypress-2-3-3/&quot;&gt; is available&lt;/a&gt; and users are encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;update as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. A few security vulnerabilities were discovered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/buddypress-components-and-features/#internal-messaging&quot;&gt;BuddyPress Messages, &lt;/a&gt;a core component that allows users to send and receive private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability was responsibly disclosed to the BuddyPress team that could allow members to manipulate a failed private outbound message and inject unexpected output to the browser. The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof Katowicz-Kowalewski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the first vulnerability, the BuddyPress core development team independently discovered and fixed related vulnerabilities with the messages component that could allow for carefully crafted private message content to be rendered incorrectly to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BuddyPress 2.3.3 also fixes a couple of bugs in the 2.3 codebase and improves support for backend changes made in WordPress 4.3. To protect your sites from these vulnerabilities, you should perform a full backup and &lt;strong&gt;update BuddyPress as soon as possible&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Theme Review Team Begins Phasing Out Favicon Support</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47940</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-begins-phasing-out-favicon-support</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the main features in WordPress 4.3 are Site Icons. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icon&lt;/a&gt; is an image that represents a website across multiple platforms and replaces Favicons. With Site Icons in WordPress core, the WordPress Theme Review team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;phasing out the feature&lt;/a&gt; in existing themes hosted in the theme directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;p&gt;Justin Tadlock, a theme review admin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/08/28/backward-compatible-faviconsicons/&quot;&gt;published a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that explains how to provide a backwards compatible experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Tadlock, the easiest method is to check if the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; function exists. This tells you if the user is running WordPress 4.3 and has the site icon feature available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check if the user has set up a new icon using the core WordPress feature by using the &lt;code&gt;has_site_icon()&lt;/code&gt; conditional tag which returns either &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some example code from the tutorial you can use to handle the check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if ( ! function_exists( 'has_site_icon' ) || ! has_site_icon() ) {

    // Output old, custom favicon feature.
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional information, I encourage you to read&lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/wordpress/development/backwards-compatibility-site-icons/&quot;&gt; Stephen Cronin&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; which goes into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Theme Review Team enforces a guideline where features added to core are phased out of themes within two major releases. By the time WordPress 4.5 is released, theme authors will be able to remove legacy code without disrupting the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress Community Summit Set for December 2-3, 2015</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47930</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-summit-set-for-december-2-3-2015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/08/26/2015-wordpress-community-summit-dates-announced/&quot;&gt;WordPress community summit&lt;/a&gt; will take place on December 2-3, 2015, in Philadelphia, PA two days before WordCamp US. The summit&amp;nbsp;will be held at &lt;a href=&quot;http://philadelphia.impacthub.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Impact Hub Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, a co-working space where freelancers, entrepreneurs, and social innovators work together, share ideas, and build networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ImpactHub.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47931&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ImpactHub.jpg?resize=500%2C333&quot; alt=&quot;inside Impact Hub&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Inside Impact HubImpact Hub is spacious and has dedicated meeting and conference rooms. According to the announcement, the summit is invite only similar to last year’s event at WordCamp San Francisco:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WordPress Community Summit is a smaller, invite-only event for&amp;nbsp;active members and contributors on the many teams that work to improve&amp;nbsp;WordPress: Core, Design, Mobile, Accessibility, Support, Polygots, Documentation, Themes, Plugins, Community, Meta, Training, Flow&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;TV .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey or application form will soon be published which will result in a pool from which the attendees will be invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit is a rare opportunity for members of various contributor teams to focus and work together in the same physical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual WordPress Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use, build, or make a living with WordPress, please take the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2015&quot;&gt;annual survey&lt;/a&gt;. Results will be shared during Matt Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation at WordCamp US. The more people who fill out the survey, the more representative the data will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch Mullenweg&amp;#8217;s State of the Word presentation from 2014 to see results from the previous survey.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Stream Is Shutting Down Its Cloud Data Storage October 1st</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47925</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/stream-is-shutting-down-its-cloud-data-storage-october-1st</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/introducing-stream-3/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt; and includes some significant improvements. Stream is a WordPress plugin that tracks changes to a site similar to an audit trail. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/stream-morphs-from-a-plugin-into-a-service&quot;&gt;version two was released&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, it morphed from a plugin to a service. Activity logs were stored in the cloud which lessened the amount of resources used on local webservers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version three will no longer store data in the cloud. Instead, it will store activity logs locally. The cloud service provided by Stream 2 is closing on &lt;strong&gt;October 1st&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives users a little more than a month to migrate data from the cloud to their local webserver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cloud is Expensive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke Carbis, lead developer of Stream, says the time frame was chosen based on a number of factors, &amp;#8220;We chose a 6 week migration window as a balance between bleeding cash and doing the right thing by our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s also helpful to remember that the vast majority of our users are on a Free plan, which only includes 12 weeks of storage. We are monitoring the accounts of each of our paid users and I&amp;#8217;m personally making sure that every one of them has migrated,&amp;#8221; Carbis told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move away from the cloud is largely based on cost. The majority of Stream&amp;#8217;s customers signed up to the free plan with a significant lack of interest in the Pro Subscription. Server costs were also higher than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XWP to The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lack of income from Stream 2 and acquisition talks failing, Carbis was contracted to do outside work leaving Frankie Jarrett the only person working on the project. Stream&amp;#8217;s investor decided to pull the plug on the project at the same time Jarrett decided to resign from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I heard that Frankie had resigned I gave him a call. We reminisced on our achievements, and threw around some of our ideas on what could have been. That conversation renewed my inspiration. I jotted down some notes, and that’s when things started to turn around,&amp;#8221; Carbis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members from &lt;a href=&quot;https://xwp.co/&quot;&gt;XWP&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to lend a helping hand and the project is now officially under the XWP umbrella. This allows Stream to remain free and open source. The partnership will also facilitate add-on, connectors, and adapters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#8217;s New in Stream 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream 3 is rewritten from the ground up. Activity logs use half the space in the database compared to Stream 2. It supports multisite through the use of Network Admin and uses a dependency injection model to be more extendable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Stream 3 includes a variety of improvements two notable features have been removed, Notifications and Reports. If you depend on these features, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp-stream.com/stream-3-faq/&quot;&gt;review the following FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbis and XWP are taking Stream into a new direction. Stream&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wp-stream/roadmap/&quot;&gt;proposed roadmap&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub and Carbis encourages users to not only review it, but to contribute to the project&amp;#8217;s future, &amp;#8220;I’d like to see Stream’s users contribute more to its direction. Contribution isn’t limited to ideas either. If you can design, develop, or translate, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wp-stream/stream&quot;&gt;contributing to the Stream project&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if Stream can regain the momentum it lost after transitioning to a cloud based system to store data. Now that Stream stores activity logs locally again, those in the EU should be able to use it without breaking privacy laws. Stream is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/stream/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; on the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Akismet: Quantifying Reddit Bigotry</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1859</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/08/27/quantifying-reddit-bigotry/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2015-08-30): It looks like the team who created the tool decided to retire it due to some reported accuracy concerns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never pass on the opportunity to mix in a little bit of humor with our passion for web content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our engineers, Dan Walmsley, participated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comedyhackday.org/la-2015&quot;&gt;Cultivated Wit&amp;#8217;s Comedy Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles last weekend, and his team&amp;#8217;s resulting project has since surfaced on &lt;a href=&quot;http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-tool-quantifies-reddit-bigotry&quot;&gt;Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/26/reddit-bigotry-check/&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freeredditcheck.com/&quot;&gt;Free Reddit Check&lt;/a&gt;, created by Dan&amp;#8217;s team and crowned with the day&amp;#8217;s top prize, is a site which attempts to quantify the terribleness of Reddit users based on their public comment content and subreddit participation. While perfectly suited for a hack day which pairs developers and comedians, there is certainly usefulness in determining the respectability of a potential online acquaintance. Or just knowing who to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And being obsessed with content analysis, community moderation, and keeping the web&amp;#8217;s underbelly in check, we can&amp;#8217;t help but think it&amp;#8217;s a nifty idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1859/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1859&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: First Look at the Twenty Sixteen Default WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47897</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.4 is the last scheduled major release of the year and with it will come a new default theme to replace Twenty Fifteen. On the Make WordPress Core site, Tammie Lister &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/25/introducing-twenty-sixteen/&quot;&gt;published an image gallery&lt;/a&gt; that shows off the design of Twenty Sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lister, the process of determining the new default theme has taken months, &amp;#8220;Lots of themes were considered, eventually settling on the one you see below. It’s a perfect fit,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47898&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TwentySixteenConcept.png?resize=433%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen
&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen is designed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi&quot;&gt;Takashi Irie,&lt;/a&gt; who also designed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2013/12/13/twenty-fourteen-wordpress-3-8-parker/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fourteen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://takashiirie.com/2015/03/19/twenty-fifteen-the-wordpress-default-theme-for-2015/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; default themes. Irie describes Twenty Sixteen as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modernized approach of an ever-popular layout — a horizontal masthead and an optional right sidebar that works well with both blogs and websites. It has custom color options that allow you to make your own Twenty Sixteen. The theme was designed on a harmonious fluid grid with a mobile first approach. This means it looks great on any device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theme has hints of Twenty Fourteen but is different enough to stand on its own as a unique design. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look as modern as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Twenty Fifteen&lt;/a&gt; out-of-the box but the design could change during the 4.4 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help Twenty Sixteen be the best it can be, please join the weekly meetings held every Monday and Friday at 16:00 UTC in the #core-themes channel on &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt;. The meetings are a half hour-long and start once the theme is initially added to WordPress core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think of Twenty Sixteen?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: OSTraining Makes Pods Framework Video Training Series Available for Free</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47885</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/ostraining-makes-pods-framework-video-training-series-available-for-free</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-40653&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pods.jpg?resize=628%2C290&quot; alt=&quot;pods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/&quot;&gt;OSTraining&lt;/a&gt;, a site that offers video training for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and other technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/blog/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;http://pods.io/&quot;&gt;Pods Framework&lt;/a&gt; video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;training series&lt;/a&gt; is now available for free. Steve Burge, founder of OSTraining.com, says offering the video series for free is the result of a partnership with the Pods Framework project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This project came about because the OSTraining and Pods teams bumped into each other on a regular basis. I often ran into Jim True and Josh Pollock from Pods. We met at WordCamps and WordPress meetups in Tampa, Orlando, and Miami, FL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Pods team explained that they were working on improving their documentation. They started a YouTube series, wrote tutorials, and started the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/pods-lead-developer-scott-kingsley-clark-launches-friends-of-pods-funding-campaign&quot;&gt;Friends of Pods&lt;/a&gt; initiative to support their efforts. Making the videos free is our way of contributing to the Pods project,&amp;#8221; Burge told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burge recorded the series after using Pods to create the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appalachiantrail.com/&quot;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt; website. The series provides an introduction to Pods, templates, creating a custom taxonomy, and more. Those interested can view the series on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ostraining.com/courses/class/wordpress/pods/&quot;&gt;OSTraining.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk9dCVMQRmSptuJ6YdVzMkr5&amp;v=4rm95kNxRXg&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a look at the first video in the series which introduces viewers to the Pods Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it was created in 2014, the series contains great insight into the project and provides an educational foundation for learning Pods 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Request: Alex King Rememberances</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=22017</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear WordPress community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My apologies for the selfish and personal nature of this post. I hope you will forgive me given the circumstances. As most of you know, I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as &amp;#8220;dad&amp;#8221;, but when she gets older she&amp;#8217;ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent more than a decade in the WordPress community and I&amp;#8217;d like to request that you to share a few thoughts or remembrances about me that we can compile and share with her when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have crossed paths or if I have managed to do something that you found helpful, I&amp;#8217;d love it if you would take a few minutes to write it down and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/contact&quot;&gt;send it to me&lt;/a&gt; or my wife: heatherkingcom@gmail.com. If you&amp;#8217;re willing to have the story shared publicly, please indicate that accordingly. By default, we will keep everything confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the thread: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; an ongoing story on this site. View the thread timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Step Up Your Game: How to Work With Successful WordPress Clients</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47868</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/step-up-your-game-how-to-work-with-successful-wordpress-clients</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-47869&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MarioPeshev.jpg?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Mario Y. Peshev&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Ryan Hellyer&quot; href=&quot;http://geek.ryanhellyer.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mario Peshev&lt;/a&gt;. Mario is the founder and WordPress Architect at &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/p9TnMSFMi2&quot;&gt;DevriX&lt;/a&gt; building and maintaining large WordPress-driven platforms. With over 10,000 hours of consulting and training, Mario&amp;#8217;s Yin and Yang is his Open Source advocacy and business growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning &amp;#8211; Benjamin Franklin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47879&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/StepUpYourGameFeaturedImage.png?resize=682%2C281&quot; alt=&quot;Step up your game featured image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58522126@N00/430932479&quot;&gt;Stairwell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a learnaholic for as long as I can remember and when I read the aforementioned quote, it resonates strongly with me. My prelude to WordPress years ago was one of the steps toward improvement and success and I’ve developed a special love-hate relationship with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utmost admiration about its influence over the world in terms of Open Source and opportunities for various people in different niches, and its plague of being diminished and depreciated by professional developers and successful businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to solve these issues as long as the inner circle works towards the same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: If you are happy building lego type websites with random ThemeForest themes and you see that as your future, this post is not for you. If you love doing the same repeatedly for mom and pop shops, this may not resonate with you. This is applicable to people who want to get better at what they do, be more professional, and make some impact by solving complex problems for larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress For a Better Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, I presented at a conference focused on kids and teenagers to motivate them, prepare them for the adult life, and nurture their creativity. Kids these days hardly think about their future, between their teenage emotional dramas and boring homework assignments. If you think about it, how can they be passionate about becoming someone if they have no real idea what they need to know and do on a daily basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used WordPress as an example of a platform that children can use, one that provides them with the opportunity to develop a talent or passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using WordPress for homework and general notes (or a diary) could indicate interest in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young bloggers can potentially do creative writing or copywriting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly switching themes and playing with colors might open the room to design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding plugins and trying to implement complex combinations is the first step to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing posts, looking at analytics and comparing different titles or photos is the way to marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other potential areas of course, but as long as kids can associate with an activity, become passionate about it, and start digging into it, they can save years of slacking, not to mention tens of thousands of dollars on college degrees for specialties they couldn’t care less about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why more and more people join the WordPress industry and switch boring jobs in order to make a living off of WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Types Of WordPress Services Exist?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of opportunities for WordPress work is incredible but the vast pool of WordPress jobs is so vague and blurry, that hiring and educating talent is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep an eye on dozens of job boards, portals, and freelance networks. Clients look for Virtual Assistants to get their websites built. They look for expert WordPress developers to apply content changes to their site or web designers to develop complex plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis I see references to WordPress administrators, programmers, developers, designers, marketers, digital artists, webmasters, VAs, and plenty of other job titles used improperly. As a matter of fact, I’m now fascinated when I see a WordPress related job post or an offer looking for the right type of candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news is that you can do anything with WordPress. The caveat here is that WordPress itself is not a skill. You don’t ask for an Internet expert nowadays and you don’t go to the same doctor when you have a headache or you’ve injured your leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wide industry of innocent clients and amateur service providers have made it nearly impossible to tell a developer from a marketer, or from a general user who has installed WordPress with an auto-installer twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Indecent World of WordPress Experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-39089&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JobTitleFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Job Titles Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/58871905@N03/5565517971&quot;&gt;I love &amp;#8217;84&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a lot about impostor syndrome in several reputable WordPress blogs, and people keep identifying themselves in the comments. In my opinion, this is a problem so insignificant as compared to the ever-growing pool of people claiming to be WordPress Experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last several years, I’ve interacted with people all around the world working with WordPress. From freelancers to successful business owners at conferences, and from beginner virtual assistants to full-stack consultants in social media, blogs and job networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of service providers that I’ve found is the one of &lt;em&gt;WordPress experts&lt;/em&gt;. You can easily substitute expert with specialist, guru, master, ninja and rockstar. Just open a new tab and do a few quick searches in Google, job networks, social media and view the large number of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list are &lt;em&gt;WordPress developers&lt;/em&gt;. A WordPress developer is often described as people who install plugins. There are various possible scenarios, but this is rarely the definition of an actual developer proficient in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some boards or blogs list specific skills that let you filter by programming language or a separate tool. My latest research with 200 contractors with WordPress developer titles led to 170 people who rate themselves with 4 or 5 out of 5 stars in PHP proficiency, and 30 with 3 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the 170 people in the first group, 150 were college students, Internet marketers, VAs, and people who have substituted strings in WordPress themes thanks to support forums or help from the Codex. Not a single line of code was written from scratch, let alone building anything, and 4 out of 5 or higher self-assessed their level of PHP experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom McFarlin &lt;a href=&quot;http://tommcfarlin.com/wordpress-developers-programmer-implementer/&quot;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; on the difference between a developer and implementer and I wrote an overview defining &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-job-titles-dont-mean-much-anymore&quot;&gt;various technical skills in the WordPress context&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the lack of proper training, any official educational resource or meaningful set of skills per role, both finding talent and improving one’s skills is being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge you to interview several successful clients around you who looked for skillful WordPress folks. They either happened to know the right people, were recommended someone, ended up with several freelancers who messed up big time, went AWOL and suddenly took the cash and disappeared, couldn’t deliver, or they did and the site is incredibly slow and/or got hacked soon thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s sending serious businesses away and I won’t touch the topic of under pricing services and products which brings the quality and support way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivates people to use a reliable resource in order to grow? The WordPress Foundation, nor any of the big players provide official training curriculum, and a definition for formal roles. There is no WordPress certification program (I won’t get into that to avoid unnecessary discussions), and there are no clear paths for requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WordPress Community is Filled with Amateurs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, our community is a large group mostly composed of amateurs who started using WordPress one way or another. These people started earning money and reached a point where they don’t know where they stand, what they’re proficient in, if they’re doing fine, whether they’re experts, impostors, or somewhere in the middle, and what would be helpful to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still use FTP and work with PHP 5.2-supported hosts. The most popular theme marketplaces provide products with broken and inconsistent code. The WordPress.org plugin repository accepts plenty of plugins with suspicious consistency and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these issues are recognized publicly in the WordPress community. Some hosts prohibit SSH and allow solely FTP. PHP 5.2 will be supported by Core for a while, which doesn’t motivate hosts to upgrade. Marketplaces earn millions from their top sellers, so they’re not interested in quickly bringing up quality as long as poorly coded themes sell well. There’s also no formal constantly reviewed plugin repository for high quality plugins and no one is actively backing this idea up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the last paragraph as a rant, it’s because it is. It’s meant to be a “wake up call” to clients who don’t know better and service providers who want to become better. While the WordPress Core itself is incredibly stable and flexible, the rest of the infrastructure is mostly poorly coded due to under pricing, lack of skills, and lack of more successful clients interested in backing up WordPress teams and consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different kinds of people and plenty of applications of WordPress. Whatever you do, it’s your professional duty to offer the right type of service instead of misleading your clients, and be aware of the other pertinent verticals. Moreover, it’s the only way forward working with reputable organizations and large profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a Successful Client?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-32204&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SuccessFeaturedImage.png?resize=636%2C278&quot; alt=&quot;Success Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/seeveeaar/2035597695/&quot;&gt;seeveeaar&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige Conference&lt;/a&gt; happened a few weeks ago, and Shane Pearlman from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tri.be/&quot;&gt;Modern Tribe&lt;/a&gt; shared his experience in a presentation entitled, Land the Big Fish: Strategies Acquiring Larger Clients. It’s a motivational talk that outlines different strategies on negotiating and landing larger customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the session, Pearlman is asked, “What’s in it for me to go through all of that headache to procure bigger brand names?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated at the beginning, working with successful clients is not for everyone. Some people are afraid to leave their comfort zone. Others are too lazy to learn new skills or sometimes doing the same thing repeatedly may be their perfect job. For every other entrepreneur or business player, successful clients are exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each small change is magnified when working with successful clients. Usually, they have a lot of employees, a solid budget for marketing and advertising, a lot of traffic, and various complex requirements that help them attract more leads or automate their processes. T&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hey are often respectable and have access to more capital. This allows them to invest more since their return of investment is worth it; while taking a risk due to saving a few bucks could very well ruin their reputation and harm their business. There are several examples of products or companies in the WordPress community that were hacked or where updates caused major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with successful clients is extremely rewarding and exciting, but getting there requires ace skills and solid experience, as well as the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Target Successful Clients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience with banks, telecoms, automotive, airline brands, large educational institutions and media outlets over the last 12 years as a developer and a technical lead, there are several specific areas where courageous WordPress freelancers and small business owners can focus on if they are aiming for growth and successful clients, but aren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have identified some steps for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/08/8-steps-to-move-from-freelancer-to-successful-company/&quot;&gt;moving from a freelancer to a successful company&lt;/a&gt;. Here is what we should focus on in the WordPress context in order to step up our game, understand our industry better, and start acting professionally if we want to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress is a Vague Term&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a WordPress Expert says nothing. You may be a lead developer of WordPress or someone who can memorize the order of all submenus under Settings in the admin dashboard. Both are classified as WordPress experts and that’s what many people don’t realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialize in a given niche and polish your skills. Focus on a specific group of projects &amp;#8211; membership websites, eCommerce stores, multisite installs. Become a know-it-all professional for an extensible plugin such as, BuddyPress, Gravity Forms, or Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the value you are providing and what it corresponds to. Be respectful to the broad community of professionals in your area, learn from them, ask them to be your mentors. Even the best athletes and CEOs have coaches, business mentors, and boards of directors. Find out what it is that you do whether it’s design, development, marketing, or something else and learn the skill inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Installments Don’t Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people offer WordPress services as an add-on to their portfolio of other services without realizing the impact it has on the business. While WordPress is used for plenty of purposes, it’s still a technical platform that comes with its own specific set of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what will happen if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a vulnerable plugin that is exploited and your client’s password is stolen, along with their private details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You forget to protect the media uploader and the client uploads sensitive data. Scanned images of contracts and ID cards end up in the public space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your sitemap plugin indexes protected data since you used a plugin that doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You set up a site and sell it to a client, and due to the terrible choice of plugins, the site crashes miserably and kills the server during a demonstration in front of their big clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a small list of what ifs, but they happen all the time. If you don’t possess the skills or offer the wrong service, this could damage your client’s business. Upping your game and providing solutions instead of websites allows you to take care of the infrastructure, maintenance work, support, development, security, marketing of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, be aware of the consequences and partner up with other agencies and consultants. Complete packages are what successful clients look for and inexperienced people often mess up what others have built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress Expert Skills Won’t Cut It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients look for professional skills. They have real problems that can’t be solved with yet another plugin, and they are smart enough to know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in the business of configuring themes and installing a few plugins for clients, that won’t do it for successful customers. You need to specialize in code, design, user experience, marketing, or something else that brings real value to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large clients are looking for state of the art designs, performant and secure code, brilliant marketing skills, and growth hacking strategy. Large clients are successful because they are outstanding at what they do, the services they offer, and they appreciate high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context-Specific WordPress Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large organizations take their marketing presence and technical stack seriously. They carefully delegate based on multiple factors. Being in a meeting with a large client typically means discussing a use case together with several people such as, a creative director, VP of marketing, network engineer, and project manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being skillful in your niche and ready to provide value, you have to learn the business processes of your target client. Your idea of a solution may be applicable for small sites, but it may very well be a bad fit based on the company policy or the variety of services used by the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, a creative director may require you to prepare your theme to be ADA Section 508 compliant, which is an accessibility standard required by certain organizations. The VP of marketing may ask for a Hubspot integration with Cvent within your website for proper CRM and meeting request management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network engineer could outline that they need to host the solution on-site, and set up a specific set of web application firewalls and internal web server security rules restricting certain process callbacks. The project manager might share a complicated timeline based on the organization load, holiday schedule, decision maker’s availability, conferences, and various deliverables that need to be presented by different people and other third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above are things that we’ve been asked for over the past few months. If you are used to working with a specific host using Apache, prepare for writing documentation and shipping to a restricted server running HHVM. If you use a framework that isn’t accessible, you will need to step back, explore the Section 508 standards, and build something compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic solutions are often not the right fit for large clients. But if you’re determined to learn more and become a better professional, that’s the perfect challenge for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solving More Complex Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to adjust to different environments, working with large clients means solving more complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a mom and pop shop is somewhat broken or down, it’s probably not a big deal if their site receives 100 visits per month. But for a project with tens of millions of views a month and thousands of concurrent users, it is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on larger and heavy platforms often means dealing with a lot of data, complex relationships, and solid traffic. This means that every single line of your code and business decision will inevitably impact the entire system in a way visible to hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to cope with these, you should study your specialty in detail and understand what the impact is of every single change. These skills increase your value and let you face similar challenges and solve problems that the majority of beginners can’t even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn a lot about the entire stack, and get to know hundreds of different rules. At some point you will voluntarily violate those rules, being aware of the fact that some design patterns and best practices don’t solve specific problems. It’s better to denormalize a database or minify a compression algorithm in order to solve a business problem for a large platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just as they say at a music college &amp;#8211; you learn the music theory for three years, and then you throw everything away and start playing jazz. You need to know the entire architecture and strategy first in order to decide how to optimize it in the best possible manner, whether it’s using a best practice or violating one for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaming Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have worked solo or in a small team, you will eventually need to partner up or grow. Either way, large projects are time consuming and require different expertise, and it’s unthinkable for one to know it all. Therefore, you will work with other professionals from more industries, team up and solve more complex problems together, and learn more about their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have thought about mastering a single skill, teaming up with the right people will add a few more skills as an extra perk, which will increase the potential of your main skill as well. Working with financial analysts on a project for a bank helped me to understand the entire model of loans and mortgages, as well as the internal banking policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allowed me to learn how loans and interests work in different cases and get acquainted with standardized security regulations at companies in the financial field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-44224&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HelloSecurityFeaturedImage.png?resize=688%2C368&quot; alt=&quot;Hello Security Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/8264582@N06/3383392046&quot;&gt;Two Locks&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy and security are important topics that people often misjudge. Working with large clients means more responsibility and higher impact in case of a problem. In the process of building a solution or consulting a reputable organization, you will most likely have to comply with various security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of them may seem unnecessary, there is a reason they exist. The more familiar you are with them, the better it is for you, your clients, and future endeavors. If you’re not using VPNs, SSH keys, two-factor authentication, or voice recognition IDS, this may be a good lesson for you. Why are they needed, what problems do they solve, and how can you apply them to your personal data and existing set of clients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization and Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47877&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BrainyQuote1.jpg?resize=620%2C400&quot; alt=&quot;BrainyQuote&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BrainyQuote
&lt;p&gt;In order to be helpful to large businesses as a consultant, or an agency, you need to be reliable. This may be a result of a number of testimonials, successful track record at previous companies or a good portfolio. It’s always challenging to start with large customers, so improving your skills and working hard in order to become valuable is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being organized and process-oriented is essential to most reputable organizations. The majority of them are more conservative and operate slowly, since a minor mistake could cost them millions or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rely on detailed specifications, scope of work documents, use case diagrams, UX mockups/wireframes, E/R diagrams, and a large list of documents. They include every single detail in their planning &amp;#8211; from holidays for each member of their team, to different dependencies from other service providers and third-party members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful clients have managed to build a process and scale it in a way that grows their revenue in a predictable way. In order to be able to handle large projects, you need to treat them as a small project that takes longer to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use a project management system and version control properly, define your pricing strategy, make sure to predict all of the delays for both communication and payments. Learn how large organizations operate and do your due diligence upfront in order to avoid surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take anything for granted and don’t assume anything. The more confident you are, the higher the possibility of making a major mistake. There are always new automatic deployment strategies or a DevOps service you haven’t heard of, another massive CSS3 grid, or a growth hacking strategy that you haven’t explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more challenges you face, the more you’ll learn, and be able to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Alex King: Personal WordPress Theme</title>
	<guid>http://alexking.org/?p=21662</guid>
	<link>http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/22/personal-wordpress-theme</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve forked the FavePersonal theme to release a few changes that I&amp;#8217;ve made to it for my own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improved Gallery feature, including support for WordPress shortcode galleries. If you&amp;#8217;re uploading photos directly to your gallery post, you can use drag and drop to set the order for them now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Post Formats admin UI is now responsive and works great on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the Social plugin from the theme (requested by WP.org) &amp;#8211; it can still be installed separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make tons of misc. code changes to match new coding standards vs. previous coding standards (and pass the theme check).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/maine-gallery-510x469.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gallery&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium-img wp-image-22028&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was originally hoping to have the modified theme hosted on WordPress.org but after weeks of waiting for review, they responded that features of the theme like &lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24520#comment:4&quot;&gt;choosing colors and post formats&lt;/a&gt; should be done in separate plugins instead. This makes no sense to me as these are core features of the theme, but happily there are great places like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that will host the project for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Personal theme is quite assuredly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/?url=alexking.org&quot;&gt;mobile-friendly&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it a great fit for the importance Google&amp;#8217;s is placing on mobile-friendly sites lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexkingorg/wp-personal/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub or, for you technically minded, grab the reop with git. Just make sure to also grab the submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:alexkingorg/wp-personal.git&lt;br /&gt;
cd wp-personal&lt;br /&gt;
git submodule update --init --recursive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;threads-post-notice&quot;&gt;This post is part of the project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/project/personal&quot;&gt;Personal Theme&lt;/a&gt;. View the project timeline for more context on this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordCampus a Conference Devoted to Using WordPress in Higher Education</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47853</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordcampus-a-conference-devoted-to-using-wordpress-in-higher-education</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Higher education is a subject that &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.tv/?s=education&quot;&gt;some WordCamps&lt;/a&gt; have tackled over the years, but what if there was an event entirely devoted to it? That&amp;#8217;s the idea &lt;a href=&quot;http://bamadesigner.com&quot;&gt;Rachel Carden&lt;/a&gt; is proposing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;. The idea started off as a tweet but quickly gained momentum with others in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ooh. Dream with me: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampus?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;: A WordCamp for folks using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordPress&lt;/a&gt; in Higher Education.&quot; I like it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/heweb?src=hash&quot;&gt;#heweb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&quot;&gt;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rachel Carden (@bamadesigner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/628324358126235648&quot;&gt;August 3, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCampus is an event that would cover topics such as, how to manage a large-scale network of faculty blogs, abiding by FERPA regulations, or how to best implement single sign-on that integrates with Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carden &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-ed-conference-wordcampus/&quot;&gt;outlines her idea in detail&lt;/a&gt; on Post Status and says that even though camp is in the event&amp;#8217;s name, it doesn&amp;#8217;t imply that it would be an official WordCamp event. She&amp;#8217;s also open to organizing an event not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in speaking, sponsoring, or attending WordCampus, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;fill out the survey &lt;/a&gt;and help spread the word. The more interest Carden generates, the more likely it is that the WordPress Foundation will back the event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress Foundation Begins Accepting Applications for the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship</title>

	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-begins-accepting-applications-for-the-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KimParsell.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-36619&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/KimParsell.png?resize=655%2C418&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp San Francisco 2014 By Sheri Bigelow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordCamp San Francisco 2014 By Sheri Bigelow
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the WordPress Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/&quot;&gt;created a scholarship&lt;/a&gt; in memory of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away&quot;&gt;Kim Parsell&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate her life and contributions to WordPress. With the date and location secured for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/philadelphia-pa-to-host-wordcamp-us-december-4th-6th&quot;&gt;WordCamp US&lt;/a&gt;, applications for the scholarship are now &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/kim-parsell-scholarship-application&quot;&gt;being accepted&lt;/a&gt; by the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the scholarship are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is a scholarship for a woman contributor with financial need who has never attended WordCamp San Francisco before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will cover the ticket cost, flight, and lodging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will not cover things like taxis, meals outside the official event, or airport transportation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One scholarship is awarded per year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is funded by the WordPress Foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The application deadline is September 2, 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A decision will be made by September 16, 2015, and applicants contacted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the nature of this scholarship &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/&quot;&gt;explained here&lt;/a&gt;, applicants must fulfill four requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A woman (this includes trans women)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An active contributor to the WordPress open source project (through one of the contributor teams or as a local meetup/WordCamp organizer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone with financial need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone who has never attended WordCamp San Francisco (the precursor to WCUS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim was an older woman who encouraged others, especially women around the same age group to get involved with WordPress. In light of this, older women are highly encouraged to apply for the scholarship if you meet the other requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim once told me that attending WordCamp San Francisco 2014 was one of the best experiences of her life. It was her first WordCamp San Francisco and although she was unemployed at the time, she was able to attend thanks to financial assistance received from the &lt;a title=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to Jen Mylo, the WordPress Foundation, and Matt Mullenweg for not only creating the scholarship, but for providing the opportunity for others to potentially have the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Hybrid Core 3.0 Experiments With Community-driven Documentation</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47825</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/hybrid-core-3-0-experiments-with-community-driven-documentation</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Core 3.0, developed by Justin Tadlock, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://themehybrid.com/weblog/hybrid-core-version-3-0-mr-reynolds&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;. More than a year in the making, 3.0 has over 269 commits and a slew of new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the release of Hybrid Core 2.0 last year, Tadlock assumed it would be at least two years before he tackled another major release, &amp;#8220;I’d planned on doing minor and patch releases for a while, all along building themes,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;However, a lot has changed in the theming world in just the past year. WordPress has added a lot of cool features for theme authors that were previously handled by Hybrid Core,&amp;#8221; Tadlock said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadlock wants the project to feel fresh and one way to do that is to remove features that are handled natively by WordPress. Features removed from Hybrid Core include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atomic hooks functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random Custom Background extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Featured Header extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaner Caption extension (handled in WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop title/description (replaced by WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pagination (replaced by WP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s clear that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/&quot;&gt;customizer in WordPress is here to stay&lt;/a&gt; and will be an important part of the project&amp;#8217;s future. Hybrid Core 3.0 adds a variety of enhancements that make the customizer more flexible, these include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color Palette.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Checkbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropdown Terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio Image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple Select.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a few customizer setting classes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Array Map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image Data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tadlock Experiments with Community-driven Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the largest changes to the Hybrid project is opening up documentation to be community-driven. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/wiki&quot;&gt;Hybrid Core wiki&lt;/a&gt; hosted on Github is now open to contributions from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadlock believes that this will drive adoption of the framework by more theme authors, &amp;#8220;The more developers we have using and contributing to the project, the better,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the community responds well to the experiment, it will allow Tadlock to focus on longer-form tutorials for club members, something he feels he&amp;#8217;s better at doing than reference style documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Core 3.0 includes a number of features, bug fixes, and improvements. If you want to see all of the changes in 3.0, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/justintadlock/hybrid-core/blob/master/changelog.md&quot;&gt;lengthy changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress 4.3 “Billie” Named After Jazz Singer Billie Holiday Is Available for Download</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47803</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-billie-named-after-jazz-singer-billie-holiday-is-available-for-download</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After four months of development led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://konstantin.obenland.it/&quot;&gt;Konstantin Obenland&lt;/a&gt;, WordPress 4.3 &amp;#8220;Billie&amp;#8221; named after jazz singer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billieholiday.com/&quot;&gt;Billie Holiday&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/billie/&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;. This release features menus in the customizer, strong passwords by default, site icons, and variety of other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Menus in the Customizer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now create, add, and edit menus in the customizer while previewing changes to your site in real-time. Unlike other parts of the customizer, previewing menus should be fast as it uses a new hybrid transport layer. Weston Ruter, who contributed to fast previews in the customizer &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/fast-previewing-changes-to-menus-in-the-customizer/&quot;&gt;explains the approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to enable fast previewing of menu changes by default. So we implemented a &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;refresh&lt;/code&gt; hybrid approach which uses &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt; to sync the menus settings to the preview, and then the preview does an Ajax request to render just the contents of the menu container, and this Ajax response is then inserted into the DOM to replace the previous menu container. The technical name for this approach we have been calling &amp;#8216;partial refresh&amp;#8217;, but you can call it fast preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, previewing menus in most themes should be a fast experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/menu-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47806&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/menu-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Menu Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Menu Customizer
&lt;h2&gt;Strong Passwords by Default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Jaquith &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/&quot;&gt;led the effort&lt;/a&gt; to improve the way passwords are chosen and changed in WordPress. On the account management page, clicking the Generate Password button generates a strong password by default. The password strength meter is better integrated into the password field which lets users know immediately when their password is weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/better-passwords.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47807&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/better-passwords.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Better Passwords in WordPress&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Better Passwords in WordPress
&lt;p&gt;The same interface is on the add new user screen, the password reset screen, and the WordPress install screen. While WordPress doesn&amp;#8217;t require users to have a strong password, it does everything it can to encourage users to choose one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, WordPress no longer emails passwords and password reset links expire after 24 hours. When your password or e-mail changes, WordPress sends you an email so if someone hijacks your browser session and changes these items, you’ll be notified that it happened, and you can take action. You can disable these e-mails via the &lt;code&gt;send_pass_change_email&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;send_email_change_email&lt;/code&gt; filters by setting them to false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Site Icons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-adds-new-site-icons-feature-and-a-text-editor-to-press-this&quot;&gt;Site Icons&lt;/a&gt; are images that represent a website across multiple platforms. You can configure your Site Icon in the Site Identity panel within the customizer where you can upload a 512X512 sized image. This image will be used for browsers, iOS, Android, and Microsoft devices when a visitor bookmarks your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47808&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/site-icon-customizer.png?resize=1010%2C568&quot; alt=&quot;Site Icons in The Customizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Site Icons in The Customizer
&lt;h2&gt;Text Patterns, Quick Link Toolbar, and Word Count Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editor in WordPress 4.3 has &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/text-patterns-and-the-quick-link-toolbar-in-wordpress-4-3&quot;&gt;undergone more improvements&lt;/a&gt; with text shortcuts, a quick link toolbar, and word count changes. Text patterns or text shortcuts allow you to quickly add unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, and blockquotes without having to use a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When starting a new paragraph with one of these formatting shortcuts followed by a space, the formatting will be applied automatically. Press Backspace or Escape to undo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the visual editor in WordPress 4.3, typing &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and hitting the space bar will generate a bulleted list. Typing &lt;code&gt;1. &lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;1)&lt;/code&gt; and hitting space will generate a numbered list. If you don’t want to create these lists or do so in error, clicking the undo button or hitting &lt;code&gt;ctrl/cmd+z&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt; will undo the text pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a paragraph with two to six number signs &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a heading. Similarly, the greater-than symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;## = H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### = H3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### = H4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;##### = H5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;###### = H6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick Link Preview Toolbar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click a link in the WordPress 4.3 visual editor, a small inline link toolbar displays the full URL with buttons to edit or remove it. This avoids having to use the Insert/edit link modal window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47792&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png?resize=571%2C102&quot; alt=&quot;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3
&lt;p&gt;Word and character counts have also changed in WordPress 4.3. Instead of updating counts when pressing enter or return, it will refresh when you stop typing. A lot more characters that shouldn’t be counted as words are excluded. Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe, WordPress core contributor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/wordcharacter-count-updates-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;lists other notable changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to the Admin Bar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 moves the Customize link to the top-level menu of the admin bar. This link opens the customizer, allowing you to manage menus, appearance, and widgets through the customizer interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46995 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP42AdminBar.png?resize=429%2C232&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.2 Admin Bar
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-46996 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WP43AdminBar.png?resize=428%2C202&quot; alt=&quot;WP43AdminBar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Admin Bar
&lt;p&gt;The Dashboard, Themes, Widgets, and Menus links take users to their corresponding admin pages in the backend of WordPress. This makes it clear which interface users are about to enter. The enhancement is a result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32678&quot;&gt;ticket #32678&lt;/a&gt; where Helen Hou-Sandí and other WordPress core contributors discussed ways to improve the context of each link over the course of five weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Noteworthy Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-improves-user-search-and-turns-comments-off-on-pages-by-default&quot;&gt;Comments are turned off on pages by default&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Singular.php was added to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/06/singular-php-new-theme-template-in-wordpress-4-3/&quot;&gt;WordPress template hierarchy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes to c&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/27/changes-to-customizer-panels-and-sections-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;ustomizer panels and sections.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/31/headings-in-admin-screens-change-in-wordpress-4-3/&quot;&gt;Header tags were updated through the admin screens&lt;/a&gt;. Plugin, theme, and framework developers, please change the main heading from an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; into an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Also, check the rest of your heading structure to ensure it’s semantic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/24/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;Multisite focused changes in 4.3&lt;/a&gt; specifically, the introduction of get_main_network_id()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/30/get_transient-is-now-more-strict-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;get_transient() is now more strict in 4.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/29/old-distraction-free-writing-code-removed-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;Distraction Free Writing (DFW) code has been removed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code that powered the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/30/legacy-theme-preview-removed-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;old theme preview has been removed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/08/list-table-changes-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;List tables have undergone API and UI changes&lt;/a&gt;, with the introduction of a primary column concept and easier subclassing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 is the result of hundreds of paid and non-paid volunteers working tirelessly to improve the software used on more than 24% of the web. If you experience any issues with WordPress 4.3, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;report them on the support forums&lt;/a&gt;. Volunteers are watching support threads closely and if warranted, will create a thread listing known issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enjoy the full upgrade experience, I encourage you to listen to Lady sings The Blues by Billie Holiday as you upgrade your WordPress sites.&lt;/p&gt;

Or maybe that person is you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://automattic.com/work-with-us/&quot;&gt;Automattic is hiring for a variety of positions&lt;/a&gt;, and for all except two you can live and work wherever you like in the entire planet. There are also a number of other benefits; the main downside it&amp;#8217;s a high performance culture and expectations are extremely high. Automattic hires the best folks regardless of geography, and we are &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; looking for people right now outside of US timezones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Text Patterns and the Quick Link Toolbar in WordPress 4.3</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47790</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/text-patterns-and-the-quick-link-toolbar-in-wordpress-4-3</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/QuickLinkToolbarFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47794&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/QuickLinkToolbarFeaturedImage.png?resize=675%2C209&quot; alt=&quot;Quick Link Toolbar Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/34547181@N00/4309431757&quot;&gt;metal chain&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;(license)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.3 is on schedule to be released &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-3-project-schedule/&quot;&gt;August 18th&lt;/a&gt; and contains a number of improvements. Among the enhancements to the visual editor are text patterns. Text patterns or text shortcuts allow you to quickly add unordered lists, ordered lists, headers, and blockquotes without having to use a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the visual editor in WordPress 4.3, typing &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and hitting the space bar will generate a bulleted list. Typing &lt;code&gt;1. &lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;1)&lt;/code&gt; and hitting space will generate a numbered list. If you don&amp;#8217;t want to create these lists or do so in error, clicking the undo button or hitting &lt;code&gt;ctrl/cmd+z&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt; will undo the text pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a paragraph with two to six number signs &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a heading. Similarly, the greater-than symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will convert the paragraph to a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;## = H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;### = H3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;#### = H4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;##### = H5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;###### = H6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a few tries to figure out but once I got the hang of it, I discovered that I prefer using text patterns versus clicking the appropriate button in the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the blockquote text pattern places text into a blockquote and automatically closes it while also starting a new paragraph. Traditionally, I highlight text and click on the blockquote button in the editor. Often times, I have to visit the text editor and close the blockquote to start a new paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Boren, WordPress core lead developer, created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/01/editor-enhancements-in-4-3-%E2%9C%A8/&quot;&gt;following video&lt;/a&gt; which shows the text patterns in action on a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Previews of Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress 4.2 included a subtle but convenient feature for adding links to text. Pasting the URL to highlighted text automatically turns it into a link. The problem is that there isn&amp;#8217;t an easy way to preview the URL without opening it in a new browser tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click a link in the WordPress 4.3 visual editor, a small inline link toolbar displays the full URL with buttons to edit or remove it. This avoids having to use the Insert/edit link modal window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47792&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PreviewLinks.png?resize=571%2C102&quot; alt=&quot;Preview Links in The Visual Editor WordPress 4.3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preview Links in The WordPress 4.3 Visual Editor
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to Word and Character Counts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word and character counts have also changed in WordPress 4.3. Instead of updating counts when pressing enter or return, it will refresh when you stop typing. A lot more characters that shouldn&amp;#8217;t be counted as words are excluded. Ella Iseulde Van Dorpe, WordPress core contributor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/23/wordcharacter-count-updates-in-4-3/&quot;&gt;lists other notable changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;character&lt;/strong&gt; count, we no longer exclude any of these characters. This means that numbers and common western punctuation are no longer excluded compared to 4.2. Emoji and other astral characters are now counted as one character instead of two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a new type &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt;, in addition to words and characters, that will count characters including spaces. This seemed necessary for Japanese and maybe other languages. This is now &lt;code&gt;character_including_spaces&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;character_excluding_spaces&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcodes and HTML comments are now excluded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view details and a summary of all the work that went into improving word counts, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30966&quot;&gt;ticket #30966&lt;/a&gt; on trac. As someone who uses the WordPress content editor for a living, I&amp;#8217;m anxiously looking forward to utilizing these enhancements on an everyday basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: A WordPress conference for higher education: coming to a campus near you?</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14001</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/wordpress-higher-ed-conference-wordcampus/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor&amp;#8217;s Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Thus far, there have been numerous niche WordPress conferences aiming toward for-profit initiatives and geared toward businesses, marketers, or eCommerce site owners. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://bamadesigner.com/&quot;&gt;Rachel Carden&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s concept for a niche, education focused, non-profit event is unique and I&amp;#8217;d love to see it happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As she notes, universities have unique challenges for managing websites and are also great candidates for utilizing WordPress to its full potential. What follows is her pitch and public brainstorming session on what a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org/&quot;&gt;higher education focused WordPress conference&lt;/a&gt; might look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all started with a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ooh. Dream with me: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordCampus?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordCampus&lt;/a&gt;: A WordCamp for folks using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordPress&lt;/a&gt; in Higher Education.&quot; I like it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/heweb?src=hash&quot;&gt;#heweb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&quot;&gt;https://t.co/m1zEkpkP4B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rachel Carden (@bamadesigner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/628324358126235648&quot;&gt;August 3, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCamp U.S. made a big announcement that was all over Twitter, Chris Lema tweeted what we were all thinking, and I couldn’t help but start daydreaming about the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I’m a web designer and developer with a passion for all things WordPress, especially using WordPress to build the world of higher ed web. Having spent the last 8 years working in higher education, I’m always looking for ways to utilize the power of WordPress to fulfill my campus’s needs and to help its communication grow, whether it’s using the powerful CMS to stretch limited resources or using its new API capabilities to share information, and break down silos, across campus departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love attending WordCamps and other WordPress-related events, but the issues we generally encounter in higher ed are often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like online businesses or blogging, higher ed is a world of its own with unique challenges, content, stakeholders, and target audiences. In our world, we don’t worry so much about which eCommerce plugin is best. Instead, we’re more concerned with things like how to manage a large-scale network of faculty blogs, making sure we’re abiding with FERPA regulations, or wondering how to best implement single sign-on that integrates with Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m proposing a new event in the WordPress community: a conference focused on using WordPress in the world of higher education. I call the idea “WordCampus”. (Kind of a perfect name, right? How did nobody think of this before?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name “WordCampus” came to me from a tweet and does not, at this point, imply it would be an official WordCamp event. If needed, I’m open to organizing an event that is not affiliated with the WordPress Foundation. This is a detail that remains to be seen, but honestly, at this point, all details remain to be seen. A WordCamp representative has confirmed that a user group specific WordCamp is possible, but I would need to prove that it could draw a crowd. That’s why I need your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a WordPress conference for higher ed is something you would be interested in (whether it’s as an attendee, speaker, planner, sponsor, or all of the above), I invite you to read a few of my thoughts, share yours in the comments, and visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org/&quot;&gt;wordcampus.org&lt;/a&gt; to show your support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cost and fee consideration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like your usual WordCamp, the goal for this event is to keep the costs and ticket price as low as possible. The point of this event is professional development and community, not profit. The phrases “big budget” and “higher ed” don’t generally appear in the same sentence anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of higher ed-oriented web conferences can run upwards of $500 so an inexpensive, but valuable, event would be attractive for most higher education web professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unique sponsorship opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having sponsors to help with costs would be crucial and I am open to all kinds of support, whether it’s monetary or in-kind. Sponsoring an event like WordCampus would be a unique way to get an organization’s name in front of one of the best communities &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of WordPress that &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; WordPress all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of higher education, you often have limited resources, so there are plenty of opportunities for third party products or services like hosting, themes, plugins, custom design, accessibility consulting, and custom development, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Location is a factor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location could be a sticking point, as high travel costs might be a deal breaker for many WordCampus attendees. The beauty of local WordCamps is that they are tied to a geographical region and therefore, for most attendees, have limited travel requirements. This could be a problem for an event that is not tied to a specific region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue wise, universities have beautiful facilities, so I’d love to host the event on an actual college campus and, if the hosting university could donate the space in kind, this would be a huge cost saver. The most preferable universities would also be located near a major airport to help reduce travel time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m really dreaming big, it would be great to find numerous universities that would be willing to host and, therefore, we could have regional WordCampus events spread across the country. I don’t think this is outside the realm of possibility, but would depend on interest and attendance. I&amp;#8217;m certainly interested in hearing from anyone that may be interested in hosting WordCampus at their university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A big target audience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a wide variety of WordPress users in higher ed, from the university-level WordPress developers and administrators, to the users who run WordPress for a college, to the faculty members using WordPress as a learning tool, and any students who’d love to learn a thing or two (they are our future, you know). That’s not even including content strategists, designers, social media managers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordCampus has the potential to attract a variety of users who could inspire a multitude of topics and professional development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A broad variety of topics, even within the education umbrella&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of topics, these could also run the gamut from higher ed marketing and content strategy to infrastructure, managing multi-author blogs, and streamlining application processes. Accessibility should also be a featured topic as federally funded institutions are required by law to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I see the structure of higher ed as tailor-made for the open source mindset and would love to hear someone encourage collaboration and openness by comparing the ideologies of open source with the inner workings of higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Event timing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As organizing something of this magnitude takes time, I’m looking at a 2016 booking. What time of the year in 2016, however, remains to be seen. There are obviously a lot of variables at play, from venue availability to which time of the year is best for our target attendees. In higher ed, you need time to clear your schedule and request funding, so I’d want to allow for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the middle of the semester is best for most higher ed professionals, but this can vary depending on their field. And if we’re being honest, the majority of fall might be out of the question because of football season. We’ve included a straw poll &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org&quot;&gt;on the event landing page&lt;/a&gt; to help us gauge which time of year might be best for those interested in attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read through my proposal and hopefully interested parties will have a few additional thoughts for the comments. If you would like be notified of any future developments, or show your support for the project, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcampus.org&quot;&gt;wordcampus.org&lt;/a&gt; to share a little bit of information. And don’t forget to tell your friends!&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: WP REST API 1.2.3 Patches XSS Vulnerability</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47770</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-1-2-3-patches-xss-vulnerability</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WP REST API version 1.2.3 and 2.0 Beta 4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/14/rest-api-v1-2-3-and-v2-0-b4/&quot;&gt;address a security issue&lt;/a&gt; that affects sites running 1.2 or 2.0 beta. This release fixes a potential XSS vulnerability related to JSONP support in 1.2 and 2.0 of the API. Automatic updates are in progress for 1.2.3 but if your site hasn&amp;#8217;t automatically updated, the team suggests updating manually as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the security release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/&quot;&gt;2.0 Beta 4&lt;/a&gt; includes a number of enhancements, some of which break backwards compatibility. Developers and beta testers should read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/releases/tag/2.0-beta4&quot;&gt;detailed changelog&lt;/a&gt; and release notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Nick Haskins Rebrands Lasso to Editus</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47763</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/nick-haskins-rebrands-lasso-to-editus</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In mid July, Nick Haskins, founder and lead developer of Lasso, was served a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/nick-haskins-receives-cease-and-desist-letter-for-violating-lassosoft-trademarks&quot;&gt;cease and desist letter&lt;/a&gt; from LassoSoft. LassoSoft argued that Lasso violates its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=861046116&quot;&gt;registered trademarks&lt;/a&gt; and causes confusion to its customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EdiusFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-47764&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EdiusFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C182&quot; alt=&quot;Edit us Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Instead of fighting litigation, Haskins decided to rebrand the product from Lasso to&lt;a href=&quot;https://edituswp.com/lasso-is-now-editus/&quot;&gt; Editus.&lt;/a&gt; The name was suggested by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iklektive.com/&quot;&gt;Gavin Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;. According to Haskins, the only references to the name is a band in Costa Rica and a directory in Luxemburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a new domain and cloned website, Lasso 0.9.8 is available for download which includes the renaming of various admin menu items that used the term Lasso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lasso 0.9.8 Requires a Manual Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haskins says users will need to update to 0.9.8 manually because of the switch in domain names but automatic updates will return after 0.9.8,  &amp;#8220;Updates after 0.9.8, will continue to be automatic, just as the way they were before,&amp;#8221; Haskins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesopinteractive LLC is &lt;a href=&quot;http://nickhaskins.com/2015/07/on-life-and-family/&quot;&gt;looking for a buyer&lt;/a&gt; but after receiving low offers, Haskins has decided to use a broker to facilitate the sale. The broker requested that the rebrand of Lasso be completed before proceeding with the sale process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Editus has a nice ring to it, what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Death of Mobile Web</title>

	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/08/death-of-mobile-web/</link>
	<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile web and mobile in-app behaviour are not binary. When users are in the facebook app, they spend a tremendous amount of time accessing the mobile web through facebook’s own in-app browser. The same for twitter and others. We enter social apps for discovery and then access the mobile web while still in-app. It is a mistake to conflate time spent on the mobile web with time spent in a traditional browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amen. Tony Haile of Chartbeat: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonyhaile.com/2015/08/11/a-correction-around-the-death-of-the-mobile-web/&quot;&gt;A correction around the death of the mobile web.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 Adds Statistical Insights</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47740</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-version-5-4-adds-statistical-insights</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=&amp;ct=&quot;&gt;available on the app store&lt;/a&gt; and includes a couple of new features. To compliment the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-5-3-released-with-refreshed-stats-and-a-new-layout-for-posts-and-pages&quot;&gt;improvements to stats in 5.3&lt;/a&gt;, 5.4 adds a new stats screen called insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insights is similar to the Right Now widget in the WordPress dashboard in that it displays a summary of key statistics for a site including, total number of published posts, views, visitors, and the best traffic day. There&amp;#8217;s also a section that displays the current day&amp;#8217;s stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_7433.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-47744&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_7433.png?resize=282%2C500&quot; alt=&quot;Stat Insights&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stat Insights
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 5.4, you could only add images to posts that were stored on the device. WordPress for iOS 5.4 adds the ability to insert images from the WordPress media library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add an image from the WordPress media library, select media library from the menu at the top of the screen. If you have a lot of items in the media library, it may take a few minutes to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WPiPhoneMediaLibrary.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-47746&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WPiPhoneMediaLibrary.png?resize=500%2C399&quot; alt=&quot;WP For iOS 5.4 Media Library Selection&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other improvements include the ability to search the My Sites list and viewing embedded images in comments. This makes it easier to see the full context of a comment without having to view it in a different part of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the team fixed a bug that caused the app to not restore its state properly. WordPress for iOS: Version 5.4 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=&amp;ct=&quot;&gt;free and available&lt;/a&gt; on the app store. If you encounter any issues, you&amp;#8217;re encouraged to report them on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ios.forums.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress for iOS support forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Short Interview With Nikolay Bachiyski WordPress’ Security Czar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47728</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/short-interview-with-nikolay-bachiyski-wordpress-security-czar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;While on stage at &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Europe&lt;/a&gt; answering a question related to WordPress’ security track record, Matt Mullenweg named &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/nbachiyski&quot;&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski&lt;/a&gt; as the first Security Czar for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Bachiyski to learn why the role was created and what its purpose is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the responsibilities of your new role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My responsibilities are to coordinate the security efforts of&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;mostly with incident response and to make sure we respond quickly, have solid fixes, and make sure everyone involved is informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What circumstances led to this role&amp;#8217;s creation?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing too spicy around the creation of the role. As the volume of requests increased, we realized a bit more structure would be helpful so that we are more focused and use our resources wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you only handle security issues for the open source project or will you also help with Automattic’s bounty program as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other colleagues at Automattic who are responsible for the bounty program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are the connections and trust you’ve established over the last 11 years to your role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offline relationships are very important in an online community and I am lucky to know many of the members of the security team in person. This definitely makes working with them easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn More About the WordPress Security Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;d like to learn more about who&amp;#8217;s on the WordPress security team, what they do, and how they handle security releases, listen to my interview with Gary Pendergast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pendergast who works for Automattic, is a WordPress core contributor, and a member of the WordPress core security team. In the interview, we discuss what happened behind the scenes before &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/plugin-developers-demand-a-better-security-release-process-after-wordpress-4-2-3-breaks-thousands-of-websites&quot;&gt;4.2.3 was released&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Avis GPS</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45255</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/08/avis-gps/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After an amazing WordCamp Scranton on Saturday I was heading to a friend&amp;#8217;s birthday on Long Island on Sunday, a few people were surprised I had flown from New York and said driving took about the same amount of time when you factor in all the airport hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I Google Mapped it and it did look like it was only 5-6 hours from Scranton to where I was going. Being a born and raised Texan, I love a good drive, and I probably haven&amp;#8217;t had a proper road trip since my sister&amp;#8217;s birthday a few years ago when we went up Highway 1. I&amp;#8217;ve also never driven on the East Coast, and it seemed like there were some really pretty parks and lakes in between Scranton and Long Island so I ended up going to the airport anyway because that&amp;#8217;s where the rental cars were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avis.com/&quot;&gt;Avis&lt;/a&gt;. They try harder. &lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/s.ma.tt/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=604&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt; One thing they do that&amp;#8217;s pretty cool is sell  decent cables, USB wall chargers, and car chargers for a cheap price right at the check-in desk. (I always carry my own car charger, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Incase-Speed-Charger-Lightning-Cable/dp/B00P7Y6M2Y/&quot;&gt;this is my current pick&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s super-handy in Ubers as well.) Amazingly though they still try to give you one of those Garmin GPS units that&amp;#8217;s worse than your smartphone in every possible way. I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s a money maker, otherwise the only reasonable thing to do would be provide &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O5JARCI&quot;&gt;a smartphone mount&lt;/a&gt; (or have one already set up in the car) rather than saddling people with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/electronics/559938/ref=zg_b_bs_559938_1&quot;&gt;archaic, non-networked navigation device&lt;/a&gt; that has no idea about construction or traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up going to a Walmart that was nearby to pick up a car mount (price, $12) that ended up being a life-saver for the trip. &lt;strong&gt;I also believe that every person in tech should visit Walmart at least once a year, and spend time in their technology section.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s good to understand and see how people who don&amp;#8217;t live for technology every day interact with it. It&amp;#8217;s eye-opening, and it&amp;#8217;s handy to know what&amp;#8217;s in stock in case you need 50 feet of ethernet at 4 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping the car off in Manhattan, it looks like they charged me $20 for a GPS which I don&amp;#8217;t even have, so now going to need to sort out both the fee and the &amp;#8220;missing&amp;#8221; GPS system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl; dr: Smart car rental companies should ditch the GPS, provide smartphone mounts instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Organizing Team Explains Why Philadelphia Should Host WordCamp US</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47699</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/organizing-team-explains-why-philadelphia-should-host-wordcamp-us</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When organizing teams in different &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2015-now-accepting-applications-for-host-city&quot;&gt;cities applied to host&lt;/a&gt; WordCamp US earlier this year, they provided a substantial amount of information through the application process. While &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/philadelphia-pa-to-host-wordcamp-us-december-4th-6th&quot;&gt;Philadelphia will host&lt;/a&gt; the event in 2015 and 2016, their application is not public information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juliana Reyes, who writes for &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly&quot;&gt;Technical.ly Philly&lt;/a&gt;, acquired and &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly/2015/08/11/wordcamp-us-philadelphia-wordpress-devs/&quot;&gt;published a few&lt;/a&gt; of the responses from the organizing team&amp;#8217;s application, specifically questions four, nine, ten, and eleven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question nine on the application asks, why do you think your city should host WordCamp US 2015? The organizing team responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Philadelphia is the birthplace of our nation. The United States started here, and so should WordCamp US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’re ideally situated on the East Coast between New York and Washington DC, and the halfway point between the West Coast and parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With a population of 1.5 million, it is the 5th largest city in North America, and is a cultural hub for all things food, music, art, and technology. It is well-known for its many excellent medical and educational facilities, including the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Drexel University, and the University of the Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With over 1,200 daily inbound and outbound flights, Philadelphia is easy to reach from anywhere in the world. The average hotel room and cost of living, is far below any other major East Coast city, and nowhere else has cheesesteaks like we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve yet to visit Philadelphia but one thing I&amp;#8217;ve learned is that residents take their reputation for cheesesteaks seriously. Be sure to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly/2015/08/11/wordcamp-us-philadelphia-wordpress-devs/&quot;&gt;the post&lt;/a&gt; to see the team&amp;#8217;s responses to the other three questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: ThemeConf a Conference for Front-End Developers and Designers September 2nd-4th, 2015</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47686</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/themeconf-a-conference-for-front-end-developers-and-designers-september-2nd-4th-2015</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ThemeConfLogo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-47688&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ThemeConfLogo.png?resize=215%2C181&quot; alt=&quot;ThemeConf Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://themeconf.com/&quot;&gt;ThemeConf&lt;/a&gt; is a new conference set to take place September 2nd-4th, 2015, in Keswick, England aimed at front-end developers and designers. Confirmed speakers include a handful of Automattic theme wranglers, Noel Tock of Human Made, freelancer Adam Onishi, and Chris Hutchinson of The Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session schedule is expected to be released later this week however, here are some of the topics that will be covered at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Craft, workflow and best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser performance and developer tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and photography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript and REST APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Lenox and Tammie Lister, who are the primary organizers of the event, originally came up with the idea for ThemeConf at the Automattic UK Christmas dinner, &amp;#8220;Lenox wanted to bring a conference to where he lives in the Lake district and I wanted to do one focusing on themes,&amp;#8221; Lister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two have been planning the event since January of this year. Although most of the confirmed speakers work with WordPress, ThemeConf is not dedicated to it, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s geared to those making themes in general and working on the front end. We have tried hard not to focus on WordPress,&amp;#8221; Lister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ti.to/themeconf/2015&quot;&gt;Tickets for ThemeConf&lt;/a&gt; are £49 and £99 respectively. The £49 tickets are for speaker sessions only while the £99 tickets include access to a workshop on using the REST API and lunch. Accommodations in the Lake District two hours from Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Liverpool and Leeds are available through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keswick.org/&quot;&gt;Keswick.org.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Directory Surpasses One Billion Total Downloads</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47673</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-surpasses-one-billion-total-downloads</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The WordPress project achieved a milestone earlier today as the official WordPress plugin directory &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/&quot;&gt;surpassed one billion&lt;/a&gt; total downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1billiondownloads.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47674&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1billiondownloads.png?resize=944%2C312&quot; alt=&quot;One billion total plugin downloads&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;More than one billion total downloads
&lt;p&gt;According to Scott Reilly who helps maintain WordPress.org, we&amp;#8217;ll never know which plugin generated the one billionth download. That&amp;#8217;s because WordPress.org doesn&amp;#8217;t log information that matches downloads to plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A download counter exists for each plugin for each day and the total amount is the summation of all those daily download counts,&amp;#8221; Reilly said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As WordPress&amp;#8217; &lt;a href=&quot;http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all&quot;&gt;market share&lt;/a&gt; continues to grow, so does the amount of downloads from the plugin directory. The following numbers are the total amount of downloads from March 2006 to August 2015. This year, the directory is on pace to serve more than 300 million downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 2006  191,567&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2007  2,845,802&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2008  15,130,856&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2009  49,822,116&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2010  72,342,598&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2011  108,501,907&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2012  141,609,682&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2013  182,236,517&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014  241,142,505&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 2015 to August 2015  186,243,700&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took nine years for the plugin directory to reach one billion downloads, when do you think it will reach two billion?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: SkiPress a Week Long Excursion in the French Alps</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47654</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/skipress-a-week-long-excursion-in-the-french-alps</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SkiPressFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-47658&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/SkiPressFeaturedImage.png?resize=852%2C269&quot; alt=&quot;SkiPress Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you enjoy skiing and WordPress, mark your calendars for &lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;SkiPress&lt;/a&gt;, November 21-28, 2015. SkiPress is a week long excursion to Serre Chevalier, a ski resort in the French Alps. The cottage can hold up to 15 people where attendees can ski, discuss WordPress, develop code, or disconnect from technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;Bernard-Jacquet&lt;/a&gt; who writes for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wp-spread.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WP-spread&lt;/a&gt;, and helps organize the local WordPress meetup in Grenoble, France, is organizing the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooms at the cottage cost 350 euros. This amount covers the room for a week plus dinner at two restaurants. Prepare to bring some extra cash as the bus, skipass, and ski rental are additional costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s not an official deadline to book a room but the sooner you book the better. If you&amp;#8217;re interested in booking a room, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://skipressweek.com/&quot;&gt;contact Berard-Jacquet&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible so he can make arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Richard Best Publishes Human Readable Version of the GPLv2 License</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47645</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/richard-best-publishes-human-readable-version-of-the-gplv2-license</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress is licensed under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/&quot;&gt;GPLv2&lt;/a&gt; and the four freedoms it allows is considered to be its &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/&quot;&gt;Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt;. The four freedoms are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to benefit from your changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more to the GPL than the four freedoms listed above however, the license details can be difficult to read and decipher. Richard Best, a qualified lawyer in New Zealand, England, and Wales, has published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpandlegalstuff.com/a-human-readable-summary-of-the-gpl/&quot;&gt;human readable summary&lt;/a&gt; of the GPL license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by how Creative Commons offers a &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot;&gt;human readable version&lt;/a&gt; of its licenses, the summary explains the core concepts of the GPL and outlines the position in relation to copying, distribution, fees, modifications/derivative works, distributing non-source forms, termination, and downstream licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to note that the document is not endorsed by the Free Software Foundation nor a substitute for the full license text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GPLSummarySample2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47647&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GPLSummarySample2.png?resize=705%2C554&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of the human readable summary of the GPL&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sample of the human readable summary of the GPL
&lt;p&gt;I encourage everyone participating in the WordPress ecosystem to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/&quot;&gt;full license&lt;/a&gt; text at least once. However, the summary does a good job explaining the core components of the GPL without having to dig into the license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions concerning the GPL, I suggest seeking legal council with a lawyer familiar with software licensing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress Core Team Receives Praise for Their Efforts to Maintain Security</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47619</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-core-team-receives-praise-for-their-efforts-to-maintain-security</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Netanel Rubin, a vulnerability researcher for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.checkpoint.com/&quot;&gt;Check Point Software&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/&quot;&gt;credited&lt;/a&gt; for properly disclosing a security vulnerability to WordPress, published the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/08/04/wordpress-vulnerabilities-1/&quot;&gt;first in a trilogy of posts&lt;/a&gt; that explains how he discovered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability was discovered during a full audit of WordPress&amp;#8217; code base in which Rubin praised the efforts of the WordPress development team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to these frequent findings in 3rd party plug-ins’ code, barebones WordPress issues are rare, as WordPress core developers are well-trained to hold high security awareness for all released code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can confirm that during our audit of the source code, we witnessed the developers ‘leaving nothing to chance’, and implementing multiple layers of security protecting most attack vectors we could think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress developers deserve praise for their efforts to maintain such complex software in this level of security, specifically considering the presence of the notoriously trigger-happy foot-gun called PHP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.checkpoint.com/2015/08/04/wordpress-vulnerabilities-1/&quot;&gt;reading the post&lt;/a&gt; as it&amp;#8217;s a brief look into the mind of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat&quot;&gt;white hat&lt;/a&gt; security researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although WordPress has &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-4-patches-six-security-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;seen its fair share&lt;/a&gt; of security related releases this year, it&amp;#8217;s reassuring to hear a third-party whose job it is to penetrate software security praise WordPress&amp;#8217; codebase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/recap-of-prestige-a-conference-geared-towards-growing-businesses&quot;&gt;Prestige over the weekend&lt;/a&gt;, I heard a presenter say that family comes first. This isn&amp;#8217;t the first time I&amp;#8217;ve heard this advice but it&amp;#8217;s becoming more prevalent. I generally hear this advice from those who are living comfortably, have two kids or more, and/or have gone through the startup process more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a distributed worker who receives a check every two weeks. I&amp;#8217;m married, have no kids, and write about WordPress for a living. Putting family first should be easy but it&amp;#8217;s not. The last two years as a distributed worker, I&amp;#8217;ve put work before family unless it&amp;#8217;s an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, my wife and I had a serious conversation about the way I work and how it has negatively impacted our marriage. I&amp;#8217;m a late owl and on most nights, my wife sleeps alone. As a distributed worker, I get to make the rules and put myself in the best environment to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation with my wife involved words not fit for reproduction but everything she said was right. I&amp;#8217;m spending too much time on digital devices and not enough with her. Our conversation was the wake up call I didn&amp;#8217;t know I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not easy putting family first all the time. Some argue that you need to put yourself before family so that you can provide for them. Others find a critical balance between spending time with family and getting the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you put family first when there are bills that need to be paid, sites to be built, and a constant deluge of work to be done? Please share your thoughts, experiences, and advice in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress 4.2.4 Patches Six Security Vulnerabilities</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47605</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-4-patches-six-security-vulnerabilities</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/&quot;&gt;4.2.4 is available&lt;/a&gt; and patches six security vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities were discovered by outside parties and members of the WordPress core security team. This release also fixes four bugs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WPDB: When checking the encoding of strings against the database, make sure we&amp;#8217;re only relying on the return value of strings that were sent to the database. &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32279&quot;&gt;#32279&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t blindly trust the output of &lt;tt&gt;glob()&lt;/tt&gt; to be an array. &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33093&quot;&gt;#33093&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcodes: Handle &lt;tt&gt;do_shortcode('&amp;lt;[shortcode]')&lt;/tt&gt; edge cases. &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33116&quot;&gt;#33116&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortcodes: Protect newlines inside of &lt;tt&gt;CDATA&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;a class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33106&quot;&gt;#33106&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a busy year for the WordPress security team. Since the beginning of the year, there has been five security releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-1-2/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.1.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.2.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/05/wordpress-4-2-2/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.2.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-2-3/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.2.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2015/08/wordpress-4-2-4-security-and-maintenance-release/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.2.4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users should check their sites to make sure they&amp;#8217;re running 4.2.4. If your site hasn&amp;#8217;t automatically updated yet, you should perform a full backup and manually update. Sites running WordPress RC 2 are safe since it fixes the same issues as 4.2.4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Recap of Prestige a Conference Geared Towards Growing Businesses</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47580</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/recap-of-prestige-a-conference-geared-towards-growing-businesses</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PrestigeconfFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47595&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PrestigeconfFeaturedImage.png?resize=677%2C268&quot; alt=&quot;Tony Perez of Sucuri&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tony Perez of Sucuri Presenting on Security at Prestige
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, I attended &lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/&quot;&gt;Prestige&lt;/a&gt;, a conference geared towards freelancers, entrepreneurs, and small agencies looking to grow their businesses. Unlike WordCamps, plugins, themes, and WordPress in general were rarely mentioned. Instead, sessions included high level topics such as, how to land enterprise clients, knowing when to move on to the next big thing, and the benefits of partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue was perfect with plenty of space and the WiFi worked well. Lunch was an hour-long and provided on both days. The lunchroom can easily seat 300 people or more. Only a third of the space was used when attendees ate lunch providing a great environment to network with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nancy Lyons and Technology&amp;#8217;s Dirty Little Secret&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don&amp;#8217;t deal with clients or own an agency, many of the sessions at Prestige are non-applicable to my day job. However, there is one session in particular that resonated with me. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nancylyons.com/&quot;&gt;Nancy Lyons&lt;/a&gt;, founder and CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clockwork.net/&quot;&gt;Clockwork&lt;/a&gt;, shared her philosophies on hiring and getting employees engaged. Happy employees do good work but what makes them happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autonomy:  Control over time, technique, team, or task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastery: Make progress and get better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purpose: Be part of something bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the tips shared by Lyons are geared towards employers but they&amp;#8217;re just as applicable to employees. The biggest danger to agencies and freelancers is the inability to have conversations with clients about what is and isn&amp;#8217;t possible. According to Lyons, you can love someone and still tell them what they need to hear. One of the best tips she shared is to find and have fun at work as there&amp;#8217;s nothing wrong with having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Behind the Scenes of the Livestream&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prestige is &lt;a href=&quot;http://prestigeconf.com/free-livestream-minneapolis-2015/&quot;&gt;known for having&lt;/a&gt; a high quality livestream where more than 1,000 people can watch the conference live. The livestream is produced by &lt;a href=&quot;http://pixpromedia.com/&quot;&gt;PixProMedia&lt;/a&gt;. The gentleman in charge uses a TriCaster to switch between speakers and slides during sessions. Here are a couple of photographs of his equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to some viewers, watching the livestream was like being at the conference but is not a substitute for face-to-face interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffr0&quot;&gt;@jeffr0&lt;/a&gt; The learning is like being there.  I miss the handshakes in the hallway, meeting people face-to-face.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/prestigeconf?src=hash&quot;&gt;#prestigeconf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cate DeRosia (@mysweetcate) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mysweetcate/status/627924263799009280&quot;&gt;August 2, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Westwerk Is a Great Venue for After Parties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The after party was held at &lt;a href=&quot;http://westwerk.com/&quot;&gt;Westwerk&lt;/a&gt;, a WordPress development agency and primary sponsor of the event. Their office was perfect for an after party as it includes, a foosball table, Nintendo Wii, shuffleboard, drinks, pool table, and small offices for private conversations. It&amp;#8217;s one of the best after parties for a conference that I&amp;#8217;ve attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prestige is Serious Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem like a WordPress conference on the surface but Prestige is geared towards business minded people. It&amp;#8217;s highly focused and filled with information you can apply to companies in and outside of WordPress. If you want to learn how to take your business to the next level, Prestige is an excellent value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: How to Avoid This Embarrassing Sharing Bug on WordPress.com</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47476</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/how-to-avoid-embarrassing-sharing-bug-on-wordpress-com</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you use the sharing feature on WordPress.com, you may have noticed an anomaly between your post title and what&amp;#8217;s shared to social services. Since the post title is the first field to complete when writing a post, it makes sense to fill it in even if it&amp;#8217;s a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharing module on WordPress.com has a bug where the initial text in a post title is used when sharing the post to social networks. For the past several months, I&amp;#8217;ve published many articles on WordPress.com where the text within social links does not match the text used in the post title leaving me feeling embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BuginAction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47477&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BuginAction.png?resize=728%2C482&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress.com Bug in Action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress.com Bug in Action
&lt;p&gt;To avoid this embarrassment, you&amp;#8217;ll need to alter the text used in the sharing module before publishing each post. If you&amp;#8217;re using the New Dash interface on WordPress.com, locate the Sharing metabox as seen in the screenshot above. When you&amp;#8217;re ready to hit the publish button, change the text to match your title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/TheCorrectPostTitle.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47478&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/TheCorrectPostTitle.png?resize=571%2C462&quot; alt=&quot;Post Title Matches the Sharing Text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Post Title Matches the Sharing Text
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spoken to several Automattic employees at various WordPress events and they&amp;#8217;re aware of the bug. Until it&amp;#8217;s fixed, you&amp;#8217;ll need to remember to change the sharing text before you publish a post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
