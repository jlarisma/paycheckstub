<ul>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WP v4.3 Compat.</strong> This release corrects a minor backward compatibility issue with versions of WordPress before v4.3, and for installations of s2Member that still use the <code>%%user_pass%%</code> Replacement Code in their New User Email notification. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/710">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WP v4.3.1 Compat.</strong> This release corrects a compatibility issue whenever you run s2Member together with WordPress v4.3.1+. Note that WordPress v4.3 made changes to the <code>wp_new_user_notification()</code> function in WordPress core. Then, a later release of WP v4.3.1 changed it again; breaking compatibility in both instances. This release brings s2Member up-to-date with WordPress v4.3.1 and preserves backward compatibility with WordPress v4.3, as well for versions prior. Props @bridgeport. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/732">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix</strong>: Fixed a bug where the s2Member CSS and JS was not loaded on the Dashboard when WordPress was installed in a subfolder that was different from the Home URL. Props @magbicaleman. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/pull/696">Issue #696</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a security issue related to the Pro Upgrade Wizard for s2Member Pro being displayed without checking <code>current_user_can('update_plugins')</code>. Resolved. Props @raamdev for identifying this and working to implement the fix. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/697">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug impacting the <code>wp_lostpassword_url()</code> function whenever s2Member is configured to run in a Multisite Network. The link is now adjusted automatically so that a lost password is always recovered from the current site, not the Main Site in the network. Props to @raamdev See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/711">this GitHub issue</a> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Stripe Pro-Forms presented after a long block of text on a page, were not returning to the proper hash location after a Coupon Code was applied. Fixed in this release. Props @raamdev See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/730">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>SSL Edge Case:</strong> This release corrects an SSL + Protected File Download problem that may have occurred in rare circumstances. Reproducing this required that you have a user with an ISP that changed their IP address whenever they accessed a site over <code>https</code> instead of <code>http</code>, and that an s2Member Protected File Download link is presented on an HTTPS page. And, that you were using s2Member's own force-SSL filters. A symptom of this issue was to receive mysterious reports of a user getting a 503 error when trying to access a protected file. Resolved in this release. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/702">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>v150827</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WordPress v4.3 Compat./Bug Fix</strong> This release of s2Member alters the way New User Notification Emails are sent, and in how they should be formatted in WordPress v4.3+.</p>

<p>The New User Notification Email is now sent (to a user) only if they did <em>not</em> set a Custom Password during their registration; i.e., only if they need this email to set their password for the first time. In short, s2Member now follows the same approach used by WordPress v4.3+.</p>

<p>See:  <strong>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member  &#8594; General Options &#8594; Email Configuration &#8594; New User Notification</strong></p>

<p>So the purpose of this particular email has changed just a bit; i.e., the New User Notification Email. Instead of it being sent to every new user, it is only sent to users who need it for the purpose of obtaining a password which grants them access to their account for the first time.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrading to WordPress v4.3 and the latest release of s2Member?</strong></p>

<p>Please review this section of your Dashboard carefully:
<strong>s2Member  &#8594; General Options &#8594; Email Configuration &#8594; New User Notification</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using s2Member to customize the New User Notification email, you should try to update this message so that it includes the new <code>%%wp_set_pass_url%%</code> Replacement Code.</li>
</ul>

<p>See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/689#issuecomment-134563230">this comment at GitHub about the recent changes, with screenshots</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode that was causing <code>levels="0"</code> not to work, and in fact any use of a <code>0</code> in the <code>levels=""</code> attribute was broken. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/663">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond for reproducing, reporting and testing this issue.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Emoji Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in s2Member's SSL filters that can be applied with the Post/Page Custom Field <code>s2member_force_ssl</code> being set to <code>yes</code>. A symptom of this bug was to see an SSL warning in the latest release of WordPress related to the new Emoji library. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/674">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>v150722</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>New Shortcode:</strong> This release introduces a powerful new shortcode which allows you to display a user's EOT (End of Term) or NPT (next payment time) in a WordPress Post or Page. For further details and some minor limitations, please see <a href="http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2eot-shortcode-documentation/"><code>[s2Eot /]</code> Shortcode Documentation</a>. Props to @raamdev and @patdumond for their strategic assistance, feedback, and ideas for this shortcode.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Strong Password Enforcement:</strong> This release of s2Member makes it possible for a site owner to enforce strong passwords; i.e., to require a minimum number of characters and a specific strength (i.e., mix of required characters). The default minimum length in s2Member changed from <code>6</code> to <code>8</code> characters minimum. The default password strength minimum is <code>good</code>. To customize, please see: <strong>s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; Registration/Profile Fields &#38; Options</strong>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/573">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond and @KTS915 for ideas and feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>reCAPTCHA v2 Upgrade:</strong> This release of s2Member comes with an updated reCAPTCHA&#8482; integration in order to take advantage of No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA and other enhancements provided by the v2 update on Google's end.</p>

<p><em>Existing s2Member installations that already have an old set of reCAPTCHA v1 Public/Private keys will continue to function as before. However, it is suggested that you configure reCATPCHA v2 keys in order to put s2Member Pro-Forms into the v2 mode moving forward. Please see: <strong>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; CAPTCHA Anti-Spam Security</strong> where you will find instructions.</em></p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>PayPal IPN Compat.</strong> This release addresses a problem with IPN connection failures that result in a 500 Internal Server Error on the PayPal side; occurring whenever s2Member attempts to verify IPN data. Please see: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/610">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in Stripe Pro-Form Checkout Options, where a Free Registration option could cause other paid Checkout Options to result in a checkout error under the right conditions. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/569">this GitHub issue</a> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>Google Analytics Compat.</strong> This release automatically preserves <code>utc_</code> variables that are used by Google Analytics whenever a Membership Options Page redirection occurs. i.e., if a visitor comes to the site with <code>utc_</code> variables and is redirected to the Membership Options Page, because the content they were trying to access is protected; the <code>utc_</code> variables are preserved during this redirection, and delivered as part of the Membership Options Page redirect.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net Endpoint Filters:</strong> This release adds two new WordPress Filters (i.e., Hooks) that can be used by developers in certain rare cases. Hook names are <code>ws_plugin__s2member_pro_authnet_aim_endpoint_url</code> and <code>ws_plugin__s2member_pro_authnet_arb_endpoint_url</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/575#issuecomment-104077606">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details and a quick example of use.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net AIM Compat.:</strong> This release addresses a compatibility issue that came to light recently, which was actually attributed to a bug in s2Member Pro that has been sliding through unnoticed until now. The format for an expiration date sent to the Authorize.Net AIM API should be <code>MM-YYYY</code>. The format for ARB API calls is <code>YYYY-MM</code>. s2Member Pro was sending <code>YYYY-MM</code> to both APIs. Fixed in this release. Props to @raamdev for investigating this. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/576">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug:</strong> This release corrects an issue in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode that was preventing the <code>display_name</code> DB column from being searchable. This release also adds the <code>display_name</code> to the list of default <code>search_columns=""</code> that are considered by the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode. Props to @patdumond for researching this. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/578">this GitHub issue</a> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects an issue where s2Member would fail to subscribe customers to configured mailing list IDs whenever an existing customer is upgrading and you have the Double Opt-In Checkbox turned off entirely. Fixed. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/581">this GitHub issue</a> if you would like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in s2Member's Stripe Pro-Forms, related to having multiple Checkout Options. The bug resulted in a missing error message whenever one of the Checkout Options was submitted incorrectly, and also resulted in the default Checkout Option being magically selected instead of the one that a customer was working with. Props to @patdumond and @bryanthankins. See: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/586">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release fixes an issue where the s2Drip shortcode was requiring PHP 5.3+; this fix allows the shortcode to work properly with PHP 5.2+.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Compat.</strong> A call to <code>WP_Widget</code> was updated to support WordPress v4.3+. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/607">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in the s2Member IPN handler that processes full refunds. In your s2Member EOT Behavior options, if you choose the  <code>refunds,partial_refunds,reversals</code> option it results in a full refund not being processed; i.e., an EOT does not occur as expected. s2Member was incorrectly recording that your configured preference was not to process refunds whenever a full refund occurs. Fixed in this release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/614">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Wikpedia Links:</strong> Updated throughout to use an <code>https://</code> protocol. Now the Wikipedia default. This impacts mostly the back-end of s2Member which references a few articles at the Wikipedia. However, it also impacts Pro-Forms where a link is provided to users with more information about Security Codes that appear on the back of credit cards. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/617">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>qTranslate X Compat.</strong> This release includes a minor update that improves compatibility with qTranslate X. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/618">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>AWeber Compat.</strong> This release resolves an issue with AWeber rejecting subscribers that have IPv6 addresses. Until such time as AWeber adds support for IPv6 addresses, s2Member will simply send an empty IP address whenever it encounters an IPv6 address. This behavior was requested by the AWeber team. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/611">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Expiration:</strong> This release improves the way coupons that are set to expire are handled. Instead of expiring at midnight the day before the configured  expiration date, coupon codes now expire at the end of the configured day. As always, all times are calculated from GMT/UTC time, the same as WordPress itself. In short, if you set a coupon to expire Dec 5th, the coupon will now expire Dec 5th, at the end of the day (UTC time). The old behavior, was for the coupon to expire Dec 4th at midnight UTC time, which led to confusion in many cases. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/612">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>IPN Proxy Key Bug:</strong> This release corrects a minor bug in s2Member's IPN Proxy Key generation that was causing problems in just a few edge cases. This bug may have impacted your site if you had a domain name being accessed with a <code>Host:</code> header containing mixed caSe. Not normal behavior, but there are a few edge cases where it's important for s2Member to get this right in order to avoid an "Unable to verify $_POST vars." error. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/590">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Password Reset Layout:</strong> This release improves the layout/CSS applied to the WordPress password reset form in order to better separate the password strength indicator from the instructions provided by WordPress. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/585">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond, @BugRat, and @raamdev for discovering this.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member) <strong>Back-end UI Quick Links:</strong> This release resolves an overlap in the display of the quick links atop each menu page in the Dashboard. This bug impacted the lite version only. If you'd like additional details, please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/589">this GitHub issue</a>. Props to @raamdev for discovering this.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Username Compat.:</strong> This release updates s2Member's own validation against usernames in order to bring it inline with the most recent versions of WordPress core; i.e., we now allow whitespace in usernames. This release was updated so that usernames are validated only by the WordPress core function: <code>sanitize_user()</code>, which does allow single whitespace characters in usernames. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/566">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Message After Modification:</strong> This release improves the default response that a customer who is upgrading/downgrading receives after having completed checkout using a Pro-Form. Instead of asking the customer to "log back in", s2Member simply says, "Thank you. Your account has been updated.". There is no reason for a customer to log back in; i.e., this is not necessary, and that message was leading to some confusion. Note also that with Pro-Forms you can provide a Custom Return URL on Success using the <code>success=""</code> shortcode attribute. Thus, this message is simply a default. We suggest that you customize in all cases. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/580">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond for reporting this important issue.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Documentation Update:</strong> This releases improves the documentation for the <code>rrt=""</code> shortcode attribute in all Pro-Form implementations; e.g., PayPal Pro-Forms, Authorize.Net Pro-Forms, and Stripe Pro-Forms. The <code>rrt=""</code> attribute can be somewhat misleading, so we added the following: <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> If you don't offer a trial period; i.e., the first charge occurs when a customer completes checkout, you should set this to the number of additional payments, and NOT to the total number. For instance, if I want to charge the customer a total of 3 times, and one of those charges occurs when they complete checkout, I set should this to <code>rrt="2"</code> for a grand total of three all together.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects an issue with EOT calculations under a specific circumstance. If a customer registered on the site for free, and later made a purchase that included a free trial period, and they canceled within the trial period, the EOT was being incorrectly calculated based on the user's WordPress registration time instead of being based on the time that their trial began. This resulted in an immediate EOT (due to it being a date in the past), instead of being set to the end of the trial. Fixed in this release.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Documentation Update:</strong> This release replaces a specific symbol that has been used throughout the Dashboard with s2Member. Instead of the <code>⥱</code> symbol we are now using the more compatible <code>&#8594;</code> symbol instead. This is used to indicate a Dashboard path.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>E_NOTICE:</strong> Several <code>E_NOTICE</code>-level warnings were resolved in this release. Note that <code>E_NOTICE</code>-level warnings only show up in <code>WP_DEBUG</code> mode for developers, but they are frustrating nonetheless. Props to @raamdev for reporting some of these.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal Pro-Forms selling to customers who choose a Maestro/Solo card may experience problems in some circumstances. GBP currency conversion was partially failing due to a change in the underlying API that s2Member calls upon. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/605">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Opt-In Bug Fix:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects a bug that was causing members to be automatically unsubscribed from your mailing list whenever you choose to hide the Double Opt-In Box. A customer updating their profile later without this box, was being unsubscribed inadvertently. Fixed in this release. Props to @raamdev for his work in reproducing and reporting this bug. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/633">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Workaround:</strong> It came to our attention that some Stripe API calls that simply update the <code>name</code>, <code>address_state</code>, <code>address_zip</code>, and <code>address_country</code> for tax reporting purposes were resulting in a card decline even after Stripe approved the transaction. We suspect this is a bug in the Stripe API. It has been reported to Stripe. For now though, we are working around this issue by failing gracefully in such a scenario. This simple update is there only for tax reporting purposes, so if it fails it does not warrant a refusal to complete the transaction.m It is simply logged by s2Member for analysis. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/535">this GitHub issue</a> where a deeper investigation is underway for our next maintenance release.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe API Update:</strong> This release of s2Member takes advantage of the latest Stripe API version. Moving from <code>v2015-02-18</code> to <code>v2015-07-13</code>. See <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#api-changelog">this article at Stripe</a> if you'd like additional details. <em>Remember that s2Member's API calls to Stripe will always use this specific version of their API (<code>v2015-07-13</code>), even if your Stripe account is configured with an older default version. This is to ensure that s2Member works as intended for all site owners.</em></p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Prepaid Cards:</strong> This release makes it possible for site owners to reject prepaid cards if they choose to do so. Stripe has the ability to determine if a credit/debit card is backed by a prepaid funding source. If it is, you can choose to reject or allow this type of card. The default behavior is to accept it. See: <strong>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Stripe Options &#8594; Account Details &#8594; Reject or Allow Prepaid Cards</strong> for further details. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/505">this GiHub issue</a> if you'd like more information. Props to @raamdev for determining the feasibility of this feature.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> <code>Notice: Undefined index: password1</code> in <code>paypal-registration-in.inc.php</code>. This was another <code>E_NOTICE</code>-level warning that was cleaned up in this release. Props to @raamdev See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/634">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> This release fixes a bug in Stripe Pro-Forms where upon a customer applying a 100%-off coupon code, the customer is met with an erroneous error regarding a missing state/zipcode--and only when a site owner has defined a tax configuration file also. Fixed in this release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/548">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Automatic Update Compat.:</strong> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Configuring_Automatic_Background_Updates">Automatic Background Updates</a> were introduced in WordPress v3.7 and while by default only WordPress core updates are updated automatically in this special way, it's still possible to enable automatic background updates for everything; including themes and plugins. For instance, some web hosting companies enable automatic/background plugin updates in an attempt to improve overall security.</p>

<p>That's fine. However, when s2Member Pro is installed, it works as an add-on for the s2Member Framework plugin, and any update of the Framework plugin requires a manual or interactive update of the Pro add-on. Otherwise your site is left with only a portion of its original functionality until you complete the update. For that reason, starting with this release of s2Member, automatic background updates of the s2Member Framework are disabled automatically when you are also running s2Member Pro.</p>

<p>Props to @raamdev for addressing this issue and providing the source code which made this enhancement possible. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/523">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p>

<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-Login /]</code> Shortcode:</strong> This release includes a new shortcode that allows you to display a login box on any Post/Page that you create with WordPress. It can also double as a way to display a user's profile summary; including their avatar.

<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-Summary /]</code> Shortcode:</strong> This release includes a new shortcode that allows you to display a user's profile summary (including avatar) in any Post/Page that you create with WordPress. It can also double as a way to display a login box in case the user is not logged in yet (optional). See: <a href="http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2member-summary-shortcode-documentation/"><code>[s2Member-Summary /]</code> Shortcode Documentation</a> for further details. Props to @patdumond for her ideas and feedback on this new feature.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Avatar via Shortcode:</strong> The <code>[s2Get /]</code> shortcode has been updated in support of user avatars, to make it easier for site owners to include a member's avatar in any WordPress Post/Page of their choosing; e.g., <code>[s2Get user_field="avatar" size="96" /]</code> produces an <code>&#60;img /&#62;</code> tag with the user's avatar. See also: <a href="http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2get-shortcode-documentation/"><code>[s2Get /]</code> Shortcode Documentation</a> for further details/examples. Props to @patdumond for her ideas and feedback on this feature.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Get date_format="" /]</code> Now Possible:</strong> The <code>[s2Get /]</code> shortcode was updated to support date formats whenever the <code>user_field=""</code> key that you want to display ends with <code>_time</code>; e.g., <code>[s2Get user_field="s2member_last_payment_time" date_format="M jS, Y, g:i a T" /]</code> produces: <code>Mar 5th, 2022, 12:00 am UTC</code> instead of a UNIX timestamp.

<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WordPress v4.3-beta Compat.:</strong> This release was tested against WordPress v4.2+, including WordPress v4.3-beta. A few minor adjustments were made to improve support in the upcoming release of WordPress v4.3 based on beta releases made available to us.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>goo.gl URL Shortener:</strong> This release addresses a problem with the Google URL Shortening API. Google now requires that you configure an API key. Otherwise, API calls will fail often and s2Member reverts back to tinyURL instead. Starting with this release, if you enable the Google URL Shortener, you will need to supply an API key for it to work as expected. See: <strong>s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; URL Shortening Service Preference</strong> for further details.

<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bitly URL Shortener:</strong> This release adds support for Bitly to be used as your preferred URL Shortening service. Bitly has become very popular for many reasons. One reason to choose Bitly over others is that you can configure your Bitly account to use a custom domain of your choosing; i.e., shortened URLs may contain <a href="https://bitly.com/a/settings/advanced">a domain that you configure</a>. See: <strong>s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; URL Shortening Service Preference</strong> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Other Gateways:</strong> Starting with this release, when you install the s2Member Pro add-on for the first time, there are two Pro gateways enabled by default. When you first install s2Member Pro (first-time users only), both the Stripe and PayPal Pro payment gateways will already be enabled for you. This is to help site owners avoid confusion. In addition, first-time users will be greeted by s2Member Pro with a reminder to configure your "Other Gateways".

<h4>v150311</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> The list of users in the WordPress Dashboard was going blank in a particular scenario where a search was attempted in concert with a sortable s2Member column. Fixed in this release. Props to @bridgeport for finding this. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/496#issuecomment-76821470">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug Fix:</strong> This release resolves an issue with pagination in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode after recent changes in the <code>WP_User_Query</code> class. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/493">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Remote Operations API (Bug Fix):</strong> If a remote API call was made to find a user by <code>user_login</code>, and that username was all numeric, the <code>WP_User</code> class treated it like a user ID instead of as an actual username. Resolved in this release by calling <code>new WP_User(0, [user login])</code> as the second argument to the constructor. Thereby forcing <code>WP_User</code> to consider it a username. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/498">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> Stripe Pro-Forms for Specific Post/Page Access should not disable the email address field for logged-in users. Resolved in this release.

<h4>v150225</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Accept Bitcoin via Stripe!</strong> This release of s2Member Pro comes integrated with the latest version of the Stripe API, where it is now possible to accept Bitcoin right along with most major credit cards&#8212;made possible by <a href="https://stripe.com/bitcoin">Stripe's latest update to support Bitcoin</a>. It's as easy as flipping a switch :-) Please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member Pro &#8594; Stripe Options &#8594; Account Details &#8594; Accept Bitcoin</code>. Referencing <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/482">this GitHub issue</a>; i.e., the original feature request.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe API Upgrade:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro updates the Stripe SDK and Stripe API to the latest version (Stripe API version: <code>2015-02-18</code>). In addition, this release forces a specific version of the Stripe API in all communication between Stripe and s2Member; thereby avoiding a scenario where the Stripe API could be updated again in the future, in ways that might prevent s2Member Pro from operating as intended.

<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Security Badge Sizes:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects an issue with the <code>[s2Member-Security-Badge v="1" /]</code> shortcode. If you set <code>v="2"</code> or <code>v="3"</code>, the dimensions were miscalculated. Props to @Mizagorn See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/pull/466">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Opt-in checkbox state (and some custom fields) were losing state when switching from one type of Pro Form to another&#8212;whenever Pro Form Checkout Options were in use. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/468">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @zenzoidman for finding this!</li>
<li>(s2Member) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Alt. View Restrictions stopped working on navigation menu items in the previous release of s2Member v150203 due to a default argument value being misinterpreted by a sub-routine. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/475">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Some site owners reported "paying" customers being left with a Membership Level of <code>0</code> at seemingly random times that may have occurred only once in every 300+ transactions. The issue was related to a regular expression being performed against encrypted binary data with an ungreedy <code>?</code> in the regex pattern. Certain characters in the binary output would be lost when specific character sequences were encountered; resulting in a random failure to decrypt cookies set by s2Member. In short, the underlying cause was identified and corrected in this release. Thanks to all who reported this. Our appreciation goes out to everyone who helped to test for this elusive bug.

<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>UI Enhancements:</strong> This release includes an enhanced UI, along with many subtle improvements to the inline documentation/instructions provided within the WordPress Dashboard.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Retiring Google Wallet:</strong> Google <a href="https://support.google.com/wallet/business/answer/6107573">announced that they are retiring Google Wallet for Digital Goods</a>. s2Member Pro continues to support Google Wallet, but this release updates the "Other Gateways" section in the Dashboard to make it clear that Google Wallet will not be supported in future versions of s2Member Pro. In fact, Google Wallet for Digital Goods will <a href="https://support.google.com/wallet/business/answer/6107573">close March 2nd, 2015</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>bbPress Bug Fix:</strong> This release resolves a security issue when running a Multisite Network with bbPress + s2Member. Level 0 access was being granted by the bbPress plugin across all sites in a network. That behavior is fine for bbPress, but is unexpected when s2Member is running in a Network environment. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/465">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. <strong>IMPORTANT TIP:</strong> If you experienced this issue, please read through <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/465#issuecomment-76039842">these important comments</a> about bbPress Participants needing to be removed from child blogs in order to fully rid yourself of this problem; i.e., once you complete the update of s2Member, you should <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/465#issuecomment-76039842">also read this please</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>404 / Alt. Views Bug Fix:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects a rare issue where the Membership Options Page (or other pages) can produce random 404 errors whenever s2Member's Alt. View Restrictions are enabled, and there is another plugin installed which runs a DB query using the <code>WP_Query</code> class <em>before</em> the Main WP Query has been run. Resolved through the use of <code>-&#62;is_main_query()</code> instead of tracking it statically via <code>$initial_query</code>.

<h4>v150203</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Gift/Redemption Codes:</strong> This release adds a powerful new shortcode: <code>[s2Member-Gift-Codes /]</code>. This makes it easy to generate and sell access to gift codes (i.e., gift certificates) and/or to a list of redemption codes. For instance,  where a single team leader might like to purchase multiple accounts they can distribute to others on a team, or in a group.

<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>User-Specific Coupon Codes:</strong> This release of s2Member makes it possible to configure Pro-Form Coupon Codes that are connected (i.e., only valid) when entered by specific Users/Members who are logged into the site. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/403">this GitHub issue</a> for additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Max Uses:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro adds the ability to set a maximum number of times that a Coupon Code can be used. This makes it easy to create Coupon Codes that are designed to be used only one time, for instance; or for X number of times. After a Coupon Code is used X number of times, it will expire automatically. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Usage Tracking:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro adds the ability to track the number of times that each of your Coupon Codes have been used. It is also possible to alter the number of uses, and/or set a maximum number of uses. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Active/Expires Dates:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro makes it possible to establish both a start and end time for each of your Pro Coupon Codes. In previous versions of s2Member, it was only possible to set an expiration date. You can now create Coupon Codes that will become active at some point in the future automatically. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>

<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Store Coupon Codes for Each User:</strong> s2Member Pro now stores a list of all coupon codes that a customer has used on your site. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; Users &#8594; Choose User [Edit]</code>. Scrolling down to the set of s2-related fields will reveal a new list of coupon codes. This list will be filled for new customers only; i.e., s2Member does not have this data for past purchases; only for new customers that you acquire after updating to the latest release.

<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>EOT Custom Value:</strong> In this release of s2Member, the <code>get_user_option('s2member_custom')</code> value is preserved after an EOT has taken place, making it possible for site owners to continue to read this value (along with any custom pipe-delimited values they have injected there), even after an EOT has taken place. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/449">this GitHub issue</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>JW Player Broken Links:</strong> This release corrects some broken links referenced by the inline documentation for s2Member in the WordPress Dashboard. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/448">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Security:</strong> This release of s2Member checks for the existence of the WordPress PHP Constant: <code>WPINC</code> instead of looking for the less reliable <code>$_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']</code>. Some site owners reported this was causing trouble in a localhost environment during testing, or when running s2Member on some hosts that are missing the <code>SCRIPT_FILENAME</code> environment variable; e.g., some Windows servers. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/454">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Advanced Import/Export Compat:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro includes compatibility and a bug fix when running on WordPress v4.1+. Three PHP notices during importation, along with some quirky behavior associated with the <code>role</code> CSV column have been corrected. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/455">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug Fix:</strong> This release resolves an issue with pagination in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode after recent improvements to the search functionality. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/155#issuecomment-69403120">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Enhancement:</strong> This release improves search functionality in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode, making it so that all searches default to <code>*[query]*</code>; i.e., are automatically wrapped by wildcards. If a user enters a wildcard explicitly (or a double quote), this default behavior is overridden and the search query is taken as given in such a scenario. This makes the search functionality easier for end-users to work with, since it no longer requires an exact match. Default behavior is now a fuzzy match. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/394">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>AWS v4 Authentication:</strong> This release of s2Member adds AWS v4 Authentication support for Amazon Web Service Regions that only accept the AWS v4 authentication scheme. If you had trouble in the recent past when attempting to integrate s2Member with S3 Buckets (or with CloudFront) in regions outside the USA, this release should resolve those issues for you. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/440">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Pro-Form Checkout Options not working in all cases whenever they are used together with Free Registration Forms. Resolved in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h4>v150102</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Custom Field Mapping:</strong> This release of s2Member adds an internal mapping from s2Member's Custom Field values for each user, to the <code>get_user_option()</code> function in the WordPress core. This makes it possible to retrieve user custom field values like always via <code>get_user_field()</code> or now through the native <code>get_user_option()</code> function also. The benefit of this is that s2Member's custom fields are now more compatible with other themes/plugins for WordPress.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>[s2Member-List /] Shortcode:</strong> It is now possible to search through custom fields created with s2Member using the <code>search_columns=""</code> attribute; e.g., <code>search_columns="user_login,user_email,s2member_custom_field_MYFIELDID"</code>; where <code>MYFIELDID</code> can be replaced with a field ID that you generate with s2Member via <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; Registration/Profile Fields</code>. See also: <a href="http://www.s2member.com/kb/s2member-list-shortcode/">this KB article</a> for further details. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/155">this GitHub issue</a> for details regarding this improvement.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>MailChimp Bug Fix</strong> This release fixes a bug first introduced in the previous release, which was causing Interest Groups configured w/ s2Member to not be added properly. Resolved in this release. Props to @ethanpil Thanks!</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>ccBill Buttons</strong> This release updates all ccBill button graphics. The MasterCard logo has been removed, and a new set of buttons was created to improve upon the set provided in previous versions of s2Member Pro. See: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/392">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net</strong> The <code>AUD</code> currency code is now supported by Authorize.Net, and thus, s2Member Pro has been updated to support the <code>AUD</code> currency code for Pro-Forms integrated with Authorize.Net. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/383">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Subscr. CID for Stripe</strong> This release corrects a bug which made it impossible to update the Subscr. CID value (for Stripe) using the user edit form in the Dashboard. For further details, please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/380">this GitHub issue</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug fix</strong> s2Member's membership access times log was failing to collect all required access times under certain scenarios where multiple CCAPS were being added or removed in succession within the same process, but across multiple function calls. This resulted in unexpected behaviors (in rare cases) when attempting to use the <code>[s2Drip /]</code> shortcode. Fixed in this release. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/406">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Compatibility</strong> This release includes a fix for s2Member's Multisite Network patches applied to the <code>wp-admin/user-new.php</code> file whenever you configure s2Member on a Multisite Network. This change makes s2Member compatible with the coming release of WordPress v4.1 and v4.2-beta as it exists now. See: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/410">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> A feature that was previously introduced in v140816, which made it possible for site owners to set a failed payment threshold (in s2Member's Authorize.Net integration), was suffering from an off-by-one issue during total failed payment calculations. Fixed in this release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/416">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Feature Enhancement:</strong> Whenever a failed payment threshold is reached (in s2Member's Authorize.Net integration), not only will s2Member terminate on-site access, but now the underlying ARB (Automated Recurring Profile) is cancelled at the same exact time. This way future billing attempts on the Authorize.Net side will not be possible; i.e., it ensures that a failed payment threshold will always terminate both on-site access and the ARB itself together at the same time, as opposed to allowing the ARB termination to occur automatically via Authorize.Net, <em>whenever</em>. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/416">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>ClickBank Disclaimer:</strong> This release of s2Member adds a default Auto-Return Header Template (customizable from <code>s2Member &#8594; ClickBank Options</code> in the Dashboard) which includes a disclaimer that ClickBank requires of most merchants before final approval.</p>

<p><em>This default template should help to reduce the time it takes new merchants to receive final approval from ClickBank when first starting out in the ClickBank network. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/412">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</em></p></li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal Pro-Forms for Specific Post/Page Access, and configured with <code>accept="paypal"</code> (i.e., to accept PayPal only) were not hiding the entire Billing Method section as intended. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/399">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal Pro-Forms using Express Checkout for Billing Agreements under a non-native currency (i.e., under a different currency than their own PayPal account) were failing under some scenarios (notably with the <code>BRL</code> currency code). Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/414">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe API:</strong> s2Member's Stripe integration has been updated to use the new <code>statement_descriptor</code> field in favor of the now deprecated <code>statement_description</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/422">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> In the case of a global tax rate having been applied to the total cost, there were certain scenarios where s2Member Pro would kick back an error message, "Invalid Parameters to Stripe". Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/425">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WP Core Compat.:</strong> This version of s2Member forces the <code>wptexturize</code> filter off in WordPress, due to a bug that was introduced in recent versions of the WordPress core; which results in broken shortcodes in some scenarios. Until the underlying bug is fixed in the WP core, the <code>wptexturize</code> filter must be disabled to prevent corruption of any WordPress shortcode that may contain <code>&#60;</code> or <code>&#62;</code> symbols.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/349">this GitHub issue</a> for further technical details. Also referencing: <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29608">this WordPress core bug report</a>.</p></li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Alt. Views:</strong> This release fixes a bug that caused <code>wp_list_pages()</code> not to be filtered properly under certain scenarios. A symptom of this bug was to apply s2Member's Alt. View protection for "Pages", but for this not work properly in all cases. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/372">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Currency Code/Symbol:</strong> All email templates, API Notifications (except cancellation/EOT notifications), and all Custom Return URLs on Success; across all payment gateways; now support two additional Replacement Codes: <code>%%currency%%</code> and <code>%%currency_symbol%%</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/314">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Codes:</strong> All transaction-related email templates now support three additional Replacement Codes: <code>%%full_coupon_code%%</code>, <code>%%coupon_code%%</code>, and <code>%%coupon_affiliate_id%%</code>. These have been documented in your Dashboard in places where transaction-related email templates are configured. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/384">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Tax Info:</strong> s2Member now attaches metadata to Stripe Charges and to Stripe Subscriptions which includes a JSON-encoded object containing two or more properties when tax applies.</p>

<p>These metadata properties can be found in your Stripe Dashboard with the metadata key: <code>tax_info</code>; which contains the following JSON-encoded properties: <code>tax</code> (total tax that was or will be charged on the regular amount), <code>tax_per</code> (tax percentage rate that was applied based on your configuration of s2Member Pro); along with <code>trial_tax</code> and <code>trial_tax_per</code> in the case of a Stripe Subscription that includes an initial/trial period that requires payment; i.e., the tax applied (if any) to an initial/trial payment on a Subscription.</p>

<p>We hope this additional information being recorded by s2Member and stored securely within your Stripe account will make it easier for you to maintain accurate bookkeeping records moving forward. This additional metadata is generated for new customers only. It will not be backfilled for any past transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Tax Info:</strong> s2Member now passes the tax location; i.e., <code>address_state</code>, <code>address_zip</code>, and <code>address_country</code> to each Stripe Card object associated with a Stripe Customer.</p>

<p>We hope this additional information being recorded by s2Member and stored securely within your Stripe account will make it easier for you to maintain accurate bookkeeping records moving forward. This additional cardholder data is collected and stored for new customers only; it will not be backfilled for any past transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe IP Address:</strong> s2Member now attaches the customer's IP address (as detected via <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> on your server) into each Stripe Customer object, along with the customer's full name. These metadata properties can be found in your Stripe Dashboard with the metadata keys: <code>name</code> and <code>ip</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Coupon Code:</strong> s2Member now attaches metadata w/ a coupon code used by your customer (if applicable) to each Stripe Charge and/or Stripe Subscription object.</p>

<p>This metadata property can be found in your Stripe Dashboard with the metadata key: <code>coupon</code>; which contains the following JSON-encoded property: <code>code</code> i.e., the full coupon code used by your customer. This additional metadata is generated for new customers only. It will not be backfilled for any past transactions. Filled only for transactions that use a coupon code.</p></li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Invoice:</strong> This release corrects a bug in s2Member's Stripe integration whereby <code>subscr-signup-as-subscr-payment</code> was not always being forced into the core gateway processor; resulting in a miscalculation of the <code>last_payment_time</code> under certain scenarios. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/396">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>

<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>ClickBank IPN v6:</strong> This release enables a new integration option for site owners integrated with ClickBank. You may now choose to integrate with v6 of ClickBank's IPN service, since all previous versions are slowly being phased out by ClickBank. Please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; ClickBank Options &#8594; IPN Integration</code> for v6 config. options.

After a html file is generated your webserver will serve that file instead of processing the comparatively heavier and more expensive WordPress PHP scripts.</p>

<p>The static html files will be served to the vast majority of your users, but because a user's details are displayed in the comment form after they leave a comment those requests are handled by the legacy caching engine. Static files are served to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Users who are not logged in.</li>
<li>Users who have not left a comment on your blog.</li>
<li>Or users who have not viewed a password protected post.</li>
</ol>

<p>99% of your visitors will be served static html files. Those users who don't see the static files will still benefit because they will see different cached files that aren't quite as efficient but still better than uncached. This plugin will help your server cope with a front page appearance on digg.com or other social networking site.</p>

<p>If for some reason "supercaching" doesn't work on your server then don't worry. Caching will still be performed, but every request will require loading the PHP engine. In normal circumstances this isn't bad at all. Visitors to your site will notice no slowdown or difference. Supercache really comes into it's own if your server is underpowered, or you're experiencing heavy traffic.
Super Cached html files will be served more quickly than PHP generated cached files but in every day use, the difference isn't noticeable.</p>

<p>The plugin serves cached files in 3 ways (ranked by speed):</p>

<ol>
<li>Mod_Rewrite. The fastest method is by using Apache mod_rewrite (or whatever similar module your web server supports) to serve "supercached" static html files. This completely bypasses PHP and is extremely quick. If your server is hit by a deluge of traffic it is more likely to cope as the requests are "lighter". This does require the Apache mod_rewrite module (which is probably installed if you have custom permalinks) and a modification of your .htaccess file. Visits by anonymous or unknown users will be served this way.</li>
<li>PHP. Supercached static files can now be served by PHP. The plugin will serve a "supercached" file if it exists and it's almost as fast as the mod_rewrite method. It's easier to configure as the .htaccess file doesn't need to be changed. You still need a custom permalink. You can keep portions of your page dynamic in this caching mode. Your server may not cope as well with a really large amount of traffic. (You're gaming Digg aren't you? You'll need mod_rewrite, the rest of us are ok with PHP!)</li>
<li>Legacy caching. This is mainly used to cache pages for known users. These are logged in users, visitors who leave comments or those who should be shown custom per-user data. It's the most flexible caching method but also the slowest. As each page is different it's often better not to cache pages for these users at all and avoid legacy caching. Legacy caching will also cache visits by unknown users if this caching mode is selected. You can have dynamic parts to your page in this mode too.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're new to caching use PHP caching. It's easy to set up and very fast. Avoid legacy caching if you can.</p>

<h4>Recommended Settings</h4>

<p>Advanced users will probably want to use mod_rewrite caching, but PHP caching is almost as good and recommended for everyone else. Enable the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>PHP caching.</li>
<li>Compress pages.</li>
<li>Don't cache pages for known users.</li>
<li>Cache rebuild.</li>
<li>CDN support.</li>
<li>Extra homepage checks.</li>
</ol>

<p>Garbage collection is the act of cleaning up cache files that are out of date and stale. There's no correct value for the expiry time but a good starting point is 1800 seconds if you're not using legacy mode. If you are using that mode start with an expiry time of 600 seconds.</p>

<p>If you are not using legacy mode caching consider deleting the contents of the "Rejected User Agents" text box and allow search engines to create supercache static files.</p>

<p>Likewise, preload as many posts as you can and enable "Preload Mode". Garbage collection will still occur but it won't affect the preloaded files. If you don't care about sidebar widgets updating often set the preload interval to 2880 minutes (2 days) so all your posts aren't recached very often. When the preload occurs the cache files for the post being refreshed is deleted and then regenerated. Afterwards a garbage collection of all old files is performed to clean out stale cache files.
With preloading on cached files will still be deleted when posts are made or edited or comments made.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache homepage</a> for further information. <a href="http://z9.io/wp-super-cache-developers/">Developer documentation</a> is also available for those who need to interact with the cache or write plugins.</p>

<p>There's a <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache">GIT repository</a> too if you want to contribute a patch.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-super-cache/trunk/Changelog.txt">changelog</a> is a good place to start if you want to know what has changed since you last downloaded the plugin.</p>

<p>Interested in translating WP Super Cache to your language? Grab the <a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-super-cache.zip">development version</a> where you will find an up to date wp-super-cache.pot. Send any translation files to donncha @ ocaoimh.ie and thank you!</p>

<p>The cache directory, usually wp-content/cache/ is only for temporary files. Do not ever put important files or symlinks to important files or directories in that directory. They will be deleted if the plugin has write access to them.</p>";s:12:"installation";s:5592:"<ol>
<li>You should have the Apache mod mime and mod rewrite modules installed and WordPress custom permalinks (Settings-&#62;Permalinks) enabled. PHP safe mode should be disabled. If any of those are missing or off you can still use PHP or legacy caching.</li>
<li>If you have WP-Cache installed already, please disable it. Edit wp-config.php and make sure the WP_CACHE and WPCACHEHOME defines are deleted, and remove the files wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and wp-content/advanced-cache.php. These will be recreated when you install this plugin.</li>
<li>Upload this directory to your plugins directory. It will create a 'wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache/' directory.</li>
<li>If you are using WordPress MU or WordPress Multisite you can install the plugin in the ordinary plugins folder and activate it "network wide".</li>
<li>WordPress users should go to their Plugins page and activate "WP Super Cache".</li>
<li>Now go to Settings-&#62;WP Super Cache and enable caching. If you see an error message or a blank screen see the "FAQ" section later in this readme for instructions.</li>
<li><p>If you choose "Mod Rewrite caching", mod_rewrite rules will be inserted into your .htaccess file. Look in your web root directory for this file. It should look similar to this:</p>

<p><code>-----------------.htaccess-----------------</code>
<code>RewriteEngine On</code>
<code>RewriteBase /</code></p>

<p><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !=POST</code>
<code>RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !.*=.*</code>

</ol>";s:3:"faq";s:21709:"<h4>How do I know my blog is being cached?</h4>

<p>Enable debugging in the plugin settings page and load the log file in a new browser tab. Then view your blog while logged in and logged out. You should see activity in the log. View the source of any page on your site. When a page is first created, you'll see the text "Dynamic page generated in XXXX seconds." and "Cached page generated by WP-Super-Cache on YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" at the end of the source code. On reload, a cached page will show the same timestamp so wait a few seconds before checking. 
In legacy caching mode, if you have compression enabled, the text "Compression = gzip" will be added. If compression is disabled and the page is served as a static html file, the text "super cache" will be added. The only other way to check if your cached file was served by PHP script or from the static cache is by looking at the HTTP headers. PHP cached pages will have the header "WP-Super-Cache: Served supercache file from PHP". Legacy cached files will have the header, "WP-Super-Cache: Served legacy cache file". I used the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3829">Live HTTP Headers</a> extension for Firefox to examine the headers. You should also check your cache directory in wp-content/cache/supercache/hostname/ for static cache files.
If the plugin rules are missing from your .htaccess file, the plugin will attempt to serve the super cached page if it's found. The header "WP-Super-Cache: Served supercache file from PHP" if this happens.</p>

<h4>Legacy (WP-Cache) vs Supercache files</h4>

<p>WP-Cache files are stored in wp-content/cache/ (or on MU sites in a blogs sub directory) and are named wp-cache-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.html. Associated meta files are stored in a meta sub directory. Those files contain information about the cached file. These files are generated by the "legacy caching" code in the plugin.
Supercache files are stored in wp-content/cache/supercache/HOSTNAME/ where HOSTNAME is your domain name. The files are stored in directories matching your site's permalink structure.</p>

<h4>Why is WP-Super-Cache better than WP-Cache?</h4>

<p>This plugin is based on the excellent WP-Cache plugin. Besides the caching WP-Cache did this plugin creates copies of every page that is accessed on a blog in a form that is quickly served by the web server. It's almost as quick as if the you had saved a html page in your browser and uploaded it to replace your homepage.</p>

<h4>Will comments and other dynamic parts of my blog update immediately?</h4>

<p>Comments will show as soon as they are moderated, depending on the comment policy of the blog owner. Other dynamic elements on a page may not update unless they are written in Javascript, Flash, Java or another client side browser language. The plugin really produces static html pages. No PHP is executed when those pages are served. "Popularity Contest" is one such plugin that will not work.</p>

<h4>Will the Super Cache compression slow down my server?</h4>

<p>No, it will do the opposite. Super Cache files are compressed and stored that way so the heavy compression is done only once. These files are generally much smaller and are sent to a visitor's browser much more quickly than uncompressed html. As a result, your server spends less time talking over the network which saves CPU time and bandwidth, and can also serve the next request much more quickly.</p>

<h4>How do I make certain parts of the page stay dynamic?</h4>

<p>Note: this functionality is disabled by default. You will have to enable it on the Advanced Settings page.</p>

<p>There are 2 ways of doing this. You can use Javascript to draw the part of the page you want to keep dynamic. That's what Google Adsense and many widgets from external sites do and is the recommended way. Or you can use a WP Super Cache filter to do the job but you can't use mod_rewrite mode caching. You have to switch to PHP or legacy caching.</p>

<p>WP Super Cache 1.4 introduced a cacheaction filter called wpsc_cachedata. The cached page to be displayed goes through this filter and allows modification of the page. If the page contains a placeholder tag the filter can be used to replace that tag with your dynamically generated html.
The function that hooks on to the wpsc_cachedata filter should be put in a file in the WP Super Cache plugins folder unless you use the late_init feature. An example plugin is included. Edit <a href="http://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-super-cache/trunk/plugins/dynamic-cache-test.php">dynamic-cache-test.php</a> to see the example code.
There are two example functions there. There's a simple function that replaces a string (or tag) you define when the cached page is served. The other example function uses an output buffer to generate the dynamic content. Due to a limitation in how PHP works the output buffer code MUST run before the wpsc_cachedata filter is hit, at least for when a page is cached. It doesn't matter when serving cached pages. See <a href="http://z9.io/y/6j">this post</a> for a more technical and longer explanation.
To execute WordPress functions you must enable the 'Late init' feature on the advanced settings page.</p>

<h4>How do I use WordPress functions in cached dynamic pages?</h4>

<h4>How do I delay serving the cache until the "init" action fires?</h4>

<p>Cached files are served before almost all of WordPress is loaded. While that's great for performance it's a pain when you want to extend the plugin using a core part of WordPress. Enable 'Late init' mode on the Advanced settings page and cached files will be served when "init" fires. WordPress and it's plugins will be loaded now.</p>

<h4>Why don't WP UserOnline, Popularity Contest, WP Postratings or plugin X not work or update on my blog now?</h4>

<p>This plugin caches entire pages but some plugins think they can run PHP code every time a page loads. To fix this, the plugin needs to use Javascript/AJAX methods or the wpsc_cachedata filter described in the previous answer to update or display dynamic information.</p>

<h4>Why do my WP Super Cache plugin disappear when I upgrade the plugin?</h4>

<p>WordPress deletes the plugin folder when it updates a plugin. This is the same with WP Super Cache so any modified files in wp-super-cache/plugins/ will be deleted. You can define the variable $wp_cache_plugins_dir in wp-config.php or wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and point it at a directory outside of the wp-super-cache folder. The plugin will look there for it's plugins.</p>

<h4>What does the Cache Rebuild feature do?</h4>

<p>When a visitor leaves a comment the cached file for that page is deleted and the next visitor recreates the cached page. A page takes time to load so what happens if it receives 100 visitors during this time? There won't be a cached page so WordPress will serve a fresh page for each user and the plugin will try to create a cached page for each of those 100 visitors causing a huge load on your server. This feature stops this happening. The cached page is not cleared when a comment is left. It is marked for rebuilding instead. The next visitor within the next 10 seconds will regenerate the cached page while the old page is served to the other 99 visitors. The page is eventually loaded by the first visitor and the cached page updated. See <a href="http://z9.io/2009/01/23/wp-super-cache-089/">this post</a> for more.</p>

<h4>Why doesn't the plugin cache requests by search engine bots by default?</h4>

<p>Those bots usually only visit each page once and if the page is not popular there's no point creating a cache file that will sit idle on your server. However if you're not using legacy caching you can allow these visits to be cached by removing the list of bots from "Rejected User Agents" on the Advanced settings page.</p>

<h4>A category page is showing instead of my homepage</h4>

<p>A tiny proportion of websites will have problems with the following configuration:</p>

<ol>
<li>Uses a static page for the front page.</li>
<li>Uses /%category%/%postname%/ permalink structure.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes a category page is cached as the homepage of the site instead of the static page. I can't <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/237415/page/2?replies=38">replicate the problem</a> but a simple solution is to switch the plugin to PHP mode. For normal traffic you will see no difference in the speed of your site. You can also enable "Extra homepage checks" on the Advanced Settings page.</p>

<h4>Why do I get warnings about caching from <a href="http://ismyblogworking.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ismyblogworking.com/</a></h4>

<p>"Your blog doesn't support client caching (no 304 response to If-modified-since)."
"Your feed doesn't support caching (no 304 response to If-modified-since)"</p>

<p>Supercache doesn't support 304 header checks in mod_rewrite mode but does support it in PHP mode. This is caching done by your browser, not the server. It is a check your browser does to ask the server if an updated version of the current page is available. If not, it doesn't download the old version again. The page is still cached by your server, just not by your visitors' browsers.
Try the Cacheability Engine at <a href="http://www.ircache.net/cgi-bin/cacheability.py" rel="nofollow">http://www.ircache.net/cgi-bin/cacheability.py</a> or <a href="http://redbot.org/" rel="nofollow">http://redbot.org/</a> for further analysis.</p>

<h4>How should I best use the utm_source tracking tools in Google Analytics with this plugin?</h4>

<p>That tracking adds a query string to each url linked from various sources like Twitter and feedreaders. Unfortunately it stops pages being supercached. See <a href="http://z9.io/remove-unused-utmsource-urls/#comment-672813">Joost's comment here</a> for how to turn it into an anchor tag which can be supercached.</p>

<h4>The plugin complains that wp-content is writable! htdocs is writable!</h4>

<p>It's not good when the web server can write to these directories but sometimes shared hosting accounts are set up in this way to make administration easier. Use <code>chmod 755 directory</code> to fix the permissions or find the permissions section of your ftp client. This <a href="http://www.google.ie/search?sourceid=chrome&#38;ie=UTF-8&#38;q=ftp+fix+directory+permissions+755">Google search</a> will lead you to more information on this topic and there's also <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions">this codex page</a> too. Unfortunately some hosts require that those directories be writable. If that's the case just ignore this warning.</p>

<h4>How do I delete the WP_CACHE define from wp-config.php?</h4>

<p>Load your desktop ftp client and connect to your site. Navigate to the root (or the directory below it) of your site where you'll find wp-config.php. Download that file and edit it in a text editor. Delete the line <code>define( 'WP_CACHE', true );</code> and save the file. Now upload it, overwriting the wp-config.php on your server.</p>

<h4>How do I delete the Super Cache rules from the .htaccess file?</h4>

<p>Load your desktop ftp client and connect to your site. You may need to enable "Show hidden files" in the preferences of the ftp client. Navigate to the root of your site where you'll find the .htaccess file. Download that file and edit it in a text editor. Delete the lines between "# BEGIN WPSuperCache" and "# END WPSuperCache" and save the file. Now upload it, overwriting the .htaccess file on your server.</p>

<h4>How do I change file permissions?</h4>

<p>This <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions">page</a> on the WordPress Codex explains everything you need to know about file permissions on your server and various ways of changing them.</p>

<h4>Why do I get load spikes when new posts are made?</h4>

<p>You may have the "clear all cached files when new posts are made" option set. Clearing those files can take time plus your visitors will now be visiting uncached pages. Are you using Google Analytics campaign tracking with utm_source in the url? Those pages aren't cached. See the question, "How should I best use the utm_source tracking tools in Google Analytics with this plugin" above for how to use them properly.
Cached pages have to be refreshed when posts are made. Perhaps your server just isn't up to the job of serving the amount of traffic you get. Enable the "cache rebuild" feature as that may help.</p>

<h4>How many pages can I cache?</h4>

<p>The only real limit are limits defined by your server. For example, EXT2 and EXT3 allow a maximum of 31,999 sub directories so if you have a flat permalink structure (like /%POSTNAME%/) and more than 32,000 posts you may run into problems. Likewise, if you run a multisite network and have more than 31,999 sites (blogs) you won't be able to cache all of them. Realistically if you had that many active sites you wouldn't be running on one server.</p>

<h4>How do I serve cached mobile pages to clients on small screens like phones and tablets?</h4>

<p>You'll have to use a separate mobile plugin to render a page formatted for those visitors. The following plugins have been tested but YMMV depending on mobile client.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack">Jetpack's Mobile Theme Module</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wptouch/">WPTouch</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mobile-edition/">WordPress Mobile Edition</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack/">WordPress Mobile Pack</a> (can't have "Don't cache pages for known users." enabled)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

<p>If things don't work when you installed the plugin here are a few things to check:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is wp-content writable by the web server?</li>
<li>Is there a wp-content/wp-cache-config.php ? If not, copy the file wp-super-cache/wp-cache-config-sample.php to wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and make sure WPCACHEHOME points at the right place.</li>
<li>Is there a wp-content/advanced-cache.php ? If not, then you must copy wp-super-cache/advanced-cache.php into wp-content/. You must edit the file and change the path so it points at the wp-super-cache folder.</li>
<li>If pages are not cached at all, remove wp-content/advanced-cache.php and recreate it, following the advice above.</li>
<li><p>Make sure the following line is in wp-config.php and it is ABOVE the "require_once(ABSPATH.'wp-settings.php');" line:</p>

<p><code>define( 'WP_CACHE', true );</code></p></li>
<li>Try the Settings-&#62;WP Super Cache page again and enable cache.</li>
<li>Look in wp-content/cache/supercache/. Are there directories and files there?</li>
<li>Anything in your php error_log?</li>
<li>If your browser keeps asking you to save the file after the super cache is installed you must disable Super Cache compression. Go to the Settings-&#62;WP Super Cache page and disable it there.</li>
<li>The plugin does not work very well when PHP's safe mode is active. This must be disabled by your administrator.</li>
<li>If pages are randomly super cached and sometimes not, your blog can probably be viewed with and without the "www" prefix on the URL. You should choose one way and install the <a href="http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/enforce-www-preference/">Enforce www preference</a> plugin if you are using an old WordPress install. The latest versions redirect themselves (you should always be running the latest version of WordPress anyway!)</li>
<li>Private Server users at Dreamhost should edit wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and set the cache dir to "/tmp/" if they are getting errors about increasing CPU usage. See this <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/145895?replies=42">discussion</a> for more.</li>
<li>File locking errors such as "failed to acquire key 0x152b: Permission denied in..." or "Page not cached by WP Super Cache. Could not get mutex lock." are a sign that you may have to use file locking. Edit wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and uncomment "$use_flock = true" or set $sem_id to a different value. You can also disable file locking from the Admin screen as a last resort.</li>
<li>Make sure cache/wp_cache_mutex.lock is writable by the web server if using coarse file locking.</li>
<li>The cache folder cannot be put on an NFS or Samba or NAS share. It has to be on a local disk. File locking and deleting expired files will not work properly unless the cache folder is on the local machine.</li>
<li><p>Garbage collection of old cache files won't work if WordPress can't find wp-cron.php. If your hostname resolves to 127.0.0.1 it could be preventing the garbage collection from working. Check your access_logs for wp-cron.php entries. Do they return a 404 (file not found) or 200 code? If it's 404 or you don't see wp-cron.php anywhere WordPress may be looking for that script in the wrong place. You should speak to your server administator to correct this or edit /etc/hosts on Unix servers and remove the following line. Your hostname must resolve to the external IP address other servers on the network/Internet use. See <a href="http://yoast.com/wp-cron-issues/" rel="nofollow">http://yoast.com/wp-cron-issues/</a> for more. A line like "127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain" is ok.</p>

<p><code>127.0.0.1 myhostname.com</code></p></li>
<li>If old pages are being served to your visitors via the supercache, you may be missing Apache modules (or their equivalents if you don't use Apache). 3 modules are required: mod_mime, mod_headers and mod_expires. The last two are especially important for making sure browsers load new versions of existing pages on your site.</li>
<li>The error message, "WP Super Cache is installed but broken. The path to wp-cache-phase1.php in wp-content/advanced-cache.php must be fixed!" appears at the end of every page. Open the file wp-content/advanced-cache.php in your favourite editor. Is the path to wp-cache-phase1.php correct? This file will normally be in wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache/. If it is not correct the caching engine will not load.</li>
<li>Caching doesn't work. The timestamp on my blog keeps changing when I reload. Check that the path in your .htaccess rules matches where the supercache directory is. You may have to hardcode it. Or use the plugin in PHP or legacy caching mode.</li>
<li><p>If supercache cache files are generated but not served, check the permissions on all your wp-content/cache/supercache folders (and each of wp-content cache and supercache folders) and wp-content/cache/.htaccess. If your PHP runs as a different user to Apache and permissions are strict Apache may not be able to read the PHP generated cache files. To fix you must add the following line to your wp-config.php (Add it above the WP_CACHE define.) Then clear your cache.</p>

<p><code>umask( 0022 );</code></p></li>
<li><p>If you see garbage in your browser after enabling compression in the plugin, compression may already be enabled in your web server. In Apache you must disable mod_deflate, or in PHP zlib compression may be enabled. You can disable that in three ways. If you have root access, edit your php.ini and find the zlib.output_compression setting and make sure it's "Off" or add this line to your .htaccess:</p>

<p><code>php_flag zlib.output_compression off</code>
If that doesn't work, add this line to your wp-config.php:</p>

<p><code>ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 0);</code></p></li>
<li>The "white screen of death" or a blank page  when you visit your site is almost always caused by a PHP error but <a href="http://www.johnberns.com/2010/03/19/wp-super-cache-blank-page-problem-fixed/">it may also be caused by APC</a>. Disable that PHP extension if you have trouble and replace with eAccelerator or Xcache.</li>
<li>After uninstalling, your permalinks may break if you remove the WordPress mod_rewrite rules too. Regenerate those rules by visiting the Settings-&#62;Permalink page and saving that form again.</li>
<li>If your blog refuses to load make sure your wp-config.php is correct. Are you missing an opening or closing PHP tag?</li>
<li>Your front page is ok but posts and pages give a 404? Go to Settings-&#62;permalinks and click "Save" once you've selected a custom permalink structure. You may need to manually update your .htaccess file.</li>
<li><p>If certain characters do not appear correctly on your website your server may not be configured correctly. You need to tell visitors what character set is used. Go to Settings-&#62;Reading and copy the 'Encoding for pages and feeds' value. Edit the .htaccess file with all your Supercache and WordPress rewrite rules and add this at the top, replacing CHARSET with the copied value. (for example, 'UTF-8')</p>

<p><code>AddDefaultCharset CHARSET</code></p></li>
<li>Use <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/cron-view/">Cron View</a> to help diagnose garbage collection and preload problems. Use the plugin to make sure jobs are scheduled and for what time. Look for the wp_cache_gc and wp_cache_full_preload_hook jobs.</li>
<li>The error message, "WP Super Cache is installed but broken. The constant WPCACHEHOME must be set in the file wp-config.php and point at the WP Super Cache plugin directory." appears at the end of every page. You can delete wp-content/advanced-cache.php and reload the plugin settings page or edit wp-config.php and look for WPCACHEHOME and make sure it points at the wp-super-cache folder. This will normally be wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache/ but you'll likely need the full path to that file (so it's easier to let the settings page fix it). If it is not correct the caching engine will not load.</li>
</ol>";s:11:"other_notes";s:5803:"<h3>How to uninstall WP Super Cache</h3>
<p>Almost all you have to do is deactivate the plugin on the plugins page. The plugin should clean up most of the files it created and modified, but it doesn't as yet remove the mod_rewrite rules from the .htaccess file. Look for the section in that file marked by SuperCache BEGIN and END tags. The plugin doesn't remove those because some people add the WordPress rules in that block too.</p>

<p>To manually uninstall:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn off caching on the plugin settings page and clear the cache.</li>
<li>Deactivate the plugin on the plugins page.</li>
<li>Remove the WP_CACHE define from wp-config.php. It looks like <code>define( 'WP_CACHE', true );</code></li>
<li>Remove the Super Cache mod_rewrite rules from your .htaccess file.</li>
<li>Remove the files wp-content/advanced-cache.php and wp-content/wp-cache-config.php</li>
<li>Remove the directory wp-content/cache/</li>
<li>Remove the directory wp-super-cache from your plugins directory.</li>
</ol>
<h3>If all else fails and your site is broken</h3>
<ol>
<li>Remove the WP_CACHE define from wp-config.php. It looks like <code>define( 'WP_CACHE', true );</code></li>
<li>Remove the rules (see above) that the plugin wrote to the .htaccess file in your root directory.</li>
<li>Delete the wp-super-cache folder in the plugins folder.</li>
<li>Optionally delete advanced-cache.php, wp-cache-config.php and the cache folder in wp-content/.</li>
</ol>
<h3>CDN</h3>
<p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is usually a network of computers situated around the world that will serve the content of your website faster by using servers close to you. Static files like images, Javascript and CSS files can be served through these networks to speed up how fast your site loads. You can also create a "poor man's CDN" by using a sub domain of your domain to serve static files too.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/ossdl-cdn-off-linker/">OSSDL CDN off-linker</a> has been integrated into WP Super Cache to provide basic CDN support. It works by rewriting the URLs of files (excluding .php files) in wp-content and wp-includes on your server so they point at a different hostname. Many CDNs support <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;q=%22origin+pull%22">origin pull</a>. This means the CDN will download the file automatically from your server when it's first requested, and will continue to serve it for a configurable length of time before downloading it again from your server.</p>

<p>Configure this on the "CDN" tab of the plugin settings page. This is an advanced technique and requires a basic understanding of how your webserver or CDNs work. Please be sure to clear the file cache after you configure the CDN.</p>
<h3>Custom Caching</h3>
<p>It is now possible to hook into the caching process using the add_cacheaction() function.</p>

<p>Three hooks are available:</p>

<ol>
<li>'wp_cache_get_cookies_values' - modify the key used by WP Cache.</li>
<li>'add_cacheaction' - runs in phase2. Allows a plugin to add WordPress hooks.</li>
<li>'cache_admin_page' - runs in the admin page. Use it to modify that page, perhaps by adding new configuration options.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is one regular WordPress filter too. Use the "do_createsupercache" filter 
to customize the checks made before caching. The filter accepts one parameter. 
The output of WP-Cache's wp_cache_get_cookies_values() function.</p>

<p>See plugins/searchengine.php as an example I use for my <a href="http://z9.io/no-adverts-for-friends/">No Adverts for Friends</a> plugin.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-widget-cache/">WP Widget Cache</a> is another caching plugin for WordPress. This plugin caches the output of widgets and may significantly speed up dynamic page generation times.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>Updates to the plugin will be posted here, to <a href="http://z9.io/">Holy Shmoly!</a> and the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache homepage</a> will always link to the newest version.</p>
<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>I would sincerely like to thank <a href="http://onemansblog.com/">John Pozadzides</a> for giving me the idea for this, for writing the "How it works" section and for testing the plugin through 2 front page appearances on digg.com</p>

<p>Thanks to James Farmer and Andrew Billits of <a href="http://edublogs.org/">Edu Blogs</a> fame who helped me make this more WordPress MU friendly.</p>

<p>Translators who did a great job converting the text of the plugin to their native language. Thank you!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WP v4.3 Compat.</strong> This release corrects a minor backward compatibility issue with versions of WordPress before v4.3, and for installations of s2Member that still use the <code>%%user_pass%%</code> Replacement Code in their New User Email notification. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/710">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WP v4.3.1 Compat.</strong> This release corrects a compatibility issue whenever you run s2Member together with WordPress v4.3.1+. Note that WordPress v4.3 made changes to the <code>wp_new_user_notification()</code> function in WordPress core. Then, a later release of WP v4.3.1 changed it again; breaking compatibility in both instances. This release brings s2Member up-to-date with WordPress v4.3.1 and preserves backward compatibility with WordPress v4.3, as well for versions prior. Props @bridgeport. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/732">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix</strong>: Fixed a bug where the s2Member CSS and JS was not loaded on the Dashboard when WordPress was installed in a subfolder that was different from the Home URL. Props @magbicaleman. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/pull/696">Issue #696</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a security issue related to the Pro Upgrade Wizard for s2Member Pro being displayed without checking <code>current_user_can('update_plugins')</code>. Resolved. Props @raamdev for identifying this and working to implement the fix. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/697">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug impacting the <code>wp_lostpassword_url()</code> function whenever s2Member is configured to run in a Multisite Network. The link is now adjusted automatically so that a lost password is always recovered from the current site, not the Main Site in the network. Props to @raamdev See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/711">this GitHub issue</a> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Stripe Pro-Forms presented after a long block of text on a page, were not returning to the proper hash location after a Coupon Code was applied. Fixed in this release. Props @raamdev See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/730">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>SSL Edge Case:</strong> This release corrects an SSL + Protected File Download problem that may have occurred in rare circumstances. Reproducing this required that you have a user with an ISP that changed their IP address whenever they accessed a site over <code>https</code> instead of <code>http</code>, and that an s2Member Protected File Download link is presented on an HTTPS page. And, that you were using s2Member's own force-SSL filters. A symptom of this issue was to receive mysterious reports of a user getting a 503 error when trying to access a protected file. Resolved in this release. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/702">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>

<h4>v150827</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WordPress v4.3 Compat./Bug Fix</strong> This release of s2Member alters the way New User Notification Emails are sent, and in how they should be formatted in WordPress v4.3+.</p>

<p>The New User Notification Email is now sent (to a user) only if they did <em>not</em> set a Custom Password during their registration; i.e., only if they need this email to set their password for the first time. In short, s2Member now follows the same approach used by WordPress v4.3+.</p>

<p>See:  <strong>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member  &#8594; General Options &#8594; Email Configuration &#8594; New User Notification</strong></p>

<p>So the purpose of this particular email has changed just a bit; i.e., the New User Notification Email. Instead of it being sent to every new user, it is only sent to users who need it for the purpose of obtaining a password which grants them access to their account for the first time.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrading to WordPress v4.3 and the latest release of s2Member?</strong></p>

<p>Please review this section of your Dashboard carefully:
<strong>s2Member  &#8594; General Options &#8594; Email Configuration &#8594; New User Notification</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using s2Member to customize the New User Notification email, you should try to update this message so that it includes the new <code>%%wp_set_pass_url%%</code> Replacement Code.</li>
</ul>

<p>See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/689#issuecomment-134563230">this comment at GitHub about the recent changes, with screenshots</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode that was causing <code>levels="0"</code> not to work, and in fact any use of a <code>0</code> in the <code>levels=""</code> attribute was broken. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/663">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond for reproducing, reporting and testing this issue.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Emoji Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in s2Member's SSL filters that can be applied with the Post/Page Custom Field <code>s2member_force_ssl</code> being set to <code>yes</code>. A symptom of this bug was to see an SSL warning in the latest release of WordPress related to the new Emoji library. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/674">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>v150722</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>New Shortcode:</strong> This release introduces a powerful new shortcode which allows you to display a user's EOT (End of Term) or NPT (next payment time) in a WordPress Post or Page. For further details and some minor limitations, please see <a href="http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2eot-shortcode-documentation/"><code>[s2Eot /]</code> Shortcode Documentation</a>. Props to @raamdev and @patdumond for their strategic assistance, feedback, and ideas for this shortcode.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Strong Password Enforcement:</strong> This release of s2Member makes it possible for a site owner to enforce strong passwords; i.e., to require a minimum number of characters and a specific strength (i.e., mix of required characters). The default minimum length in s2Member changed from <code>6</code> to <code>8</code> characters minimum. The default password strength minimum is <code>good</code>. To customize, please see: <strong>s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; Registration/Profile Fields &#38; Options</strong>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/573">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond and @KTS915 for ideas and feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>reCAPTCHA v2 Upgrade:</strong> This release of s2Member comes with an updated reCAPTCHA&#8482; integration in order to take advantage of No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA and other enhancements provided by the v2 update on Google's end.</p>

<p><em>Existing s2Member installations that already have an old set of reCAPTCHA v1 Public/Private keys will continue to function as before. However, it is suggested that you configure reCATPCHA v2 keys in order to put s2Member Pro-Forms into the v2 mode moving forward. Please see: <strong>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; CAPTCHA Anti-Spam Security</strong> where you will find instructions.</em></p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>PayPal IPN Compat.</strong> This release addresses a problem with IPN connection failures that result in a 500 Internal Server Error on the PayPal side; occurring whenever s2Member attempts to verify IPN data. Please see: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/610">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in Stripe Pro-Form Checkout Options, where a Free Registration option could cause other paid Checkout Options to result in a checkout error under the right conditions. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/569">this GitHub issue</a> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>Google Analytics Compat.</strong> This release automatically preserves <code>utc_</code> variables that are used by Google Analytics whenever a Membership Options Page redirection occurs. i.e., if a visitor comes to the site with <code>utc_</code> variables and is redirected to the Membership Options Page, because the content they were trying to access is protected; the <code>utc_</code> variables are preserved during this redirection, and delivered as part of the Membership Options Page redirect.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net Endpoint Filters:</strong> This release adds two new WordPress Filters (i.e., Hooks) that can be used by developers in certain rare cases. Hook names are <code>ws_plugin__s2member_pro_authnet_aim_endpoint_url</code> and <code>ws_plugin__s2member_pro_authnet_arb_endpoint_url</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/575#issuecomment-104077606">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details and a quick example of use.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net AIM Compat.:</strong> This release addresses a compatibility issue that came to light recently, which was actually attributed to a bug in s2Member Pro that has been sliding through unnoticed until now. The format for an expiration date sent to the Authorize.Net AIM API should be <code>MM-YYYY</code>. The format for ARB API calls is <code>YYYY-MM</code>. s2Member Pro was sending <code>YYYY-MM</code> to both APIs. Fixed in this release. Props to @raamdev for investigating this. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/576">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug:</strong> This release corrects an issue in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode that was preventing the <code>display_name</code> DB column from being searchable. This release also adds the <code>display_name</code> to the list of default <code>search_columns=""</code> that are considered by the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode. Props to @patdumond for researching this. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/578">this GitHub issue</a> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects an issue where s2Member would fail to subscribe customers to configured mailing list IDs whenever an existing customer is upgrading and you have the Double Opt-In Checkbox turned off entirely. Fixed. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/581">this GitHub issue</a> if you would like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in s2Member's Stripe Pro-Forms, related to having multiple Checkout Options. The bug resulted in a missing error message whenever one of the Checkout Options was submitted incorrectly, and also resulted in the default Checkout Option being magically selected instead of the one that a customer was working with. Props to @patdumond and @bryanthankins. See: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/586">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release fixes an issue where the s2Drip shortcode was requiring PHP 5.3+; this fix allows the shortcode to work properly with PHP 5.2+.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Compat.</strong> A call to <code>WP_Widget</code> was updated to support WordPress v4.3+. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/607">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects a bug in the s2Member IPN handler that processes full refunds. In your s2Member EOT Behavior options, if you choose the  <code>refunds,partial_refunds,reversals</code> option it results in a full refund not being processed; i.e., an EOT does not occur as expected. s2Member was incorrectly recording that your configured preference was not to process refunds whenever a full refund occurs. Fixed in this release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/614">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Wikpedia Links:</strong> Updated throughout to use an <code>https://</code> protocol. Now the Wikipedia default. This impacts mostly the back-end of s2Member which references a few articles at the Wikipedia. However, it also impacts Pro-Forms where a link is provided to users with more information about Security Codes that appear on the back of credit cards. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/617">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>qTranslate X Compat.</strong> This release includes a minor update that improves compatibility with qTranslate X. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/618">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>AWeber Compat.</strong> This release resolves an issue with AWeber rejecting subscribers that have IPv6 addresses. Until such time as AWeber adds support for IPv6 addresses, s2Member will simply send an empty IP address whenever it encounters an IPv6 address. This behavior was requested by the AWeber team. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/611">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Expiration:</strong> This release improves the way coupons that are set to expire are handled. Instead of expiring at midnight the day before the configured  expiration date, coupon codes now expire at the end of the configured day. As always, all times are calculated from GMT/UTC time, the same as WordPress itself. In short, if you set a coupon to expire Dec 5th, the coupon will now expire Dec 5th, at the end of the day (UTC time). The old behavior, was for the coupon to expire Dec 4th at midnight UTC time, which led to confusion in many cases. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/612">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>IPN Proxy Key Bug:</strong> This release corrects a minor bug in s2Member's IPN Proxy Key generation that was causing problems in just a few edge cases. This bug may have impacted your site if you had a domain name being accessed with a <code>Host:</code> header containing mixed caSe. Not normal behavior, but there are a few edge cases where it's important for s2Member to get this right in order to avoid an "Unable to verify $_POST vars." error. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/590">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Password Reset Layout:</strong> This release improves the layout/CSS applied to the WordPress password reset form in order to better separate the password strength indicator from the instructions provided by WordPress. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/585">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond, @BugRat, and @raamdev for discovering this.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member) <strong>Back-end UI Quick Links:</strong> This release resolves an overlap in the display of the quick links atop each menu page in the Dashboard. This bug impacted the lite version only. If you'd like additional details, please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/589">this GitHub issue</a>. Props to @raamdev for discovering this.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Username Compat.:</strong> This release updates s2Member's own validation against usernames in order to bring it inline with the most recent versions of WordPress core; i.e., we now allow whitespace in usernames. This release was updated so that usernames are validated only by the WordPress core function: <code>sanitize_user()</code>, which does allow single whitespace characters in usernames. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/566">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Message After Modification:</strong> This release improves the default response that a customer who is upgrading/downgrading receives after having completed checkout using a Pro-Form. Instead of asking the customer to "log back in", s2Member simply says, "Thank you. Your account has been updated.". There is no reason for a customer to log back in; i.e., this is not necessary, and that message was leading to some confusion. Note also that with Pro-Forms you can provide a Custom Return URL on Success using the <code>success=""</code> shortcode attribute. Thus, this message is simply a default. We suggest that you customize in all cases. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/580">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @patdumond for reporting this important issue.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Documentation Update:</strong> This releases improves the documentation for the <code>rrt=""</code> shortcode attribute in all Pro-Form implementations; e.g., PayPal Pro-Forms, Authorize.Net Pro-Forms, and Stripe Pro-Forms. The <code>rrt=""</code> attribute can be somewhat misleading, so we added the following: <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> If you don't offer a trial period; i.e., the first charge occurs when a customer completes checkout, you should set this to the number of additional payments, and NOT to the total number. For instance, if I want to charge the customer a total of 3 times, and one of those charges occurs when they complete checkout, I set should this to <code>rrt="2"</code> for a grand total of three all together.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> This release corrects an issue with EOT calculations under a specific circumstance. If a customer registered on the site for free, and later made a purchase that included a free trial period, and they canceled within the trial period, the EOT was being incorrectly calculated based on the user's WordPress registration time instead of being based on the time that their trial began. This resulted in an immediate EOT (due to it being a date in the past), instead of being set to the end of the trial. Fixed in this release.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Documentation Update:</strong> This release replaces a specific symbol that has been used throughout the Dashboard with s2Member. Instead of the <code>⥱</code> symbol we are now using the more compatible <code>&#8594;</code> symbol instead. This is used to indicate a Dashboard path.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>E_NOTICE:</strong> Several <code>E_NOTICE</code>-level warnings were resolved in this release. Note that <code>E_NOTICE</code>-level warnings only show up in <code>WP_DEBUG</code> mode for developers, but they are frustrating nonetheless. Props to @raamdev for reporting some of these.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal Pro-Forms selling to customers who choose a Maestro/Solo card may experience problems in some circumstances. GBP currency conversion was partially failing due to a change in the underlying API that s2Member calls upon. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/605">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Opt-In Bug Fix:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects a bug that was causing members to be automatically unsubscribed from your mailing list whenever you choose to hide the Double Opt-In Box. A customer updating their profile later without this box, was being unsubscribed inadvertently. Fixed in this release. Props to @raamdev for his work in reproducing and reporting this bug. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/633">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Workaround:</strong> It came to our attention that some Stripe API calls that simply update the <code>name</code>, <code>address_state</code>, <code>address_zip</code>, and <code>address_country</code> for tax reporting purposes were resulting in a card decline even after Stripe approved the transaction. We suspect this is a bug in the Stripe API. It has been reported to Stripe. For now though, we are working around this issue by failing gracefully in such a scenario. This simple update is there only for tax reporting purposes, so if it fails it does not warrant a refusal to complete the transaction.m It is simply logged by s2Member for analysis. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/535">this GitHub issue</a> where a deeper investigation is underway for our next maintenance release.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe API Update:</strong> This release of s2Member takes advantage of the latest Stripe API version. Moving from <code>v2015-02-18</code> to <code>v2015-07-13</code>. See <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#api-changelog">this article at Stripe</a> if you'd like additional details. <em>Remember that s2Member's API calls to Stripe will always use this specific version of their API (<code>v2015-07-13</code>), even if your Stripe account is configured with an older default version. This is to ensure that s2Member works as intended for all site owners.</em></p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Prepaid Cards:</strong> This release makes it possible for site owners to reject prepaid cards if they choose to do so. Stripe has the ability to determine if a credit/debit card is backed by a prepaid funding source. If it is, you can choose to reject or allow this type of card. The default behavior is to accept it. See: <strong>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Stripe Options &#8594; Account Details &#8594; Reject or Allow Prepaid Cards</strong> for further details. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/505">this GiHub issue</a> if you'd like more information. Props to @raamdev for determining the feasibility of this feature.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> <code>Notice: Undefined index: password1</code> in <code>paypal-registration-in.inc.php</code>. This was another <code>E_NOTICE</code>-level warning that was cleaned up in this release. Props to @raamdev See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/634">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> This release fixes a bug in Stripe Pro-Forms where upon a customer applying a 100%-off coupon code, the customer is met with an erroneous error regarding a missing state/zipcode--and only when a site owner has defined a tax configuration file also. Fixed in this release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/548">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Automatic Update Compat.:</strong> <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Configuring_Automatic_Background_Updates">Automatic Background Updates</a> were introduced in WordPress v3.7 and while by default only WordPress core updates are updated automatically in this special way, it's still possible to enable automatic background updates for everything; including themes and plugins. For instance, some web hosting companies enable automatic/background plugin updates in an attempt to improve overall security.</p>

<p>That's fine. However, when s2Member Pro is installed, it works as an add-on for the s2Member Framework plugin, and any update of the Framework plugin requires a manual or interactive update of the Pro add-on. Otherwise your site is left with only a portion of its original functionality until you complete the update. For that reason, starting with this release of s2Member, automatic background updates of the s2Member Framework are disabled automatically when you are also running s2Member Pro.</p>

<p>Props to @raamdev for addressing this issue and providing the source code which made this enhancement possible. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/523">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</p>

<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-Login /]</code> Shortcode:</strong> This release includes a new shortcode that allows you to display a login box on any Post/Page that you create with WordPress. It can also double as a way to display a user's profile summary; including their avatar. See: <a href="http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2member-login-shortcode-documentation/"><code>[s2Member-Login /]</code> Shortcode Documentation</a> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-Summary /]</code> Shortcode:</strong> This release includes a new shortcode that allows you to display a user's profile summary (including avatar) in any Post/Page that you create with WordPress. It can also double as a way to display a login box in case the user is not logged in yet (optional). See: <a href="http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2member-summary-shortcode-documentation/"><code>[s2Member-Summary /]</code> Shortcode Documentation</a> for further details. Props to @patdumond for her ideas and feedback on this new feature.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Avatar via Shortcode:</strong> The <code>[s2Get /]</code> shortcode has been updated in support of user avatars, to make it easier for site owners to include a member's avatar in any WordPress Post/Page of their choosing; e.g., <code>[s2Get user_field="avatar" size="96" /]</code> produces an <code>&#60;img /&#62;</code> tag with the user's avatar. See also: <a href="http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2get-shortcode-documentation/"><code>[s2Get /]</code> Shortcode Documentation</a> for further details/examples. Props to @patdumond for her ideas and feedback on this feature.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Get date_format="" /]</code> Now Possible:</strong> The <code>[s2Get /]</code> shortcode was updated to support date formats whenever the <code>user_field=""</code> key that you want to display ends with <code>_time</code>; e.g., <code>[s2Get user_field="s2member_last_payment_time" date_format="M jS, Y, g:i a T" /]</code> produces: <code>Mar 5th, 2022, 12:00 am UTC</code> instead of a UNIX timestamp.

<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WordPress v4.3-beta Compat.:</strong> This release was tested against WordPress v4.2+, including WordPress v4.3-beta. A few minor adjustments were made to improve support in the upcoming release of WordPress v4.3 based on beta releases made available to us.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>goo.gl URL Shortener:</strong> This release addresses a problem with the Google URL Shortening API. Google now requires that you configure an API key. Otherwise, API calls will fail often and s2Member reverts back to tinyURL instead. Starting with this release, if you enable the Google URL Shortener, you will need to supply an API key for it to work as expected. See: <strong>s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; URL Shortening Service Preference</strong> for further details. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/587">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @bridgeport for reproducing and reporting this bug.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bitly URL Shortener:</strong> This release adds support for Bitly to be used as your preferred URL Shortening service. Bitly has become very popular for many reasons. One reason to choose Bitly over others is that you can configure your Bitly account to use a custom domain of your choosing; i.e., shortened URLs may contain <a href="https://bitly.com/a/settings/advanced">a domain that you configure</a>. See: <strong>s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; URL Shortening Service Preference</strong> for further details.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Other Gateways:</strong> Starting with this release, when you install the s2Member Pro add-on for the first time, there are two Pro gateways enabled by default. When you first install s2Member Pro (first-time users only), both the Stripe and PayPal Pro payment gateways will already be enabled for you. This is to help site owners avoid confusion. In addition, first-time users will be greeted by s2Member Pro with a reminder to configure your "Other Gateways". See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/528">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @raamdev for identifying this usability issue and providing feedback/suggestions.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stats Collection:</strong> Starting w/ this release of s2Member Pro, we are now collecting important/anonymous server details that will help us better understand which versions of PHP/MySQL are most widely used by site owners running the pro version of our software. For further details, please see: <a href="http://s2member.com/kb-article/what-information-does-s2member-pro-report-to-websharks/">What anonymous information does s2Member Pro report to WebSharks, and why?</a></p></li>

<h4>v150311</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> The list of users in the WordPress Dashboard was going blank in a particular scenario where a search was attempted in concert with a sortable s2Member column. Fixed in this release. Props to @bridgeport for finding this. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/496#issuecomment-76821470">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug Fix:</strong> This release resolves an issue with pagination in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode after recent changes in the <code>WP_User_Query</code> class. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/493">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Remote Operations API (Bug Fix):</strong> If a remote API call was made to find a user by <code>user_login</code>, and that username was all numeric, the <code>WP_User</code> class treated it like a user ID instead of as an actual username. Resolved in this release by calling <code>new WP_User(0, [user login])</code> as the second argument to the constructor. Thereby forcing <code>WP_User</code> to consider it a username. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/498">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> Stripe Pro-Forms for Specific Post/Page Access should not disable the email address field for logged-in users. Resolved in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/500">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Pro-Forms:</strong> This release corrects a bug first introduced in the last release that prevented custom templates for Stripe Pro-Forms from working as intended. Please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/510">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix for Gift/Redemption Codes:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects a bug that impacted the generation of Gift/Redemption Codes whenever they were sold with Specific Post/Page Access.

<h4>v150225</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Accept Bitcoin via Stripe!</strong> This release of s2Member Pro comes integrated with the latest version of the Stripe API, where it is now possible to accept Bitcoin right along with most major credit cards&#8212;made possible by <a href="https://stripe.com/bitcoin">Stripe's latest update to support Bitcoin</a>. It's as easy as flipping a switch :-) Please see: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member Pro &#8594; Stripe Options &#8594; Account Details &#8594; Accept Bitcoin</code>. Referencing <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/482">this GitHub issue</a>; i.e., the original feature request.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe API Upgrade:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro updates the Stripe SDK and Stripe API to the latest version (Stripe API version: <code>2015-02-18</code>). In addition, this release forces a specific version of the Stripe API in all communication between Stripe and s2Member; thereby avoiding a scenario where the Stripe API could be updated again in the future, in ways that might prevent s2Member Pro from operating as intended. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/484">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details. Props to @pauloz1890 for reporting this.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Security Badge Sizes:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects an issue with the <code>[s2Member-Security-Badge v="1" /]</code> shortcode. If you set <code>v="2"</code> or <code>v="3"</code>, the dimensions were miscalculated. Props to @Mizagorn See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/pull/466">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Opt-in checkbox state (and some custom fields) were losing state when switching from one type of Pro Form to another&#8212;whenever Pro Form Checkout Options were in use. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/468">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. Props to @zenzoidman for finding this!</li>
<li>(s2Member) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Alt. View Restrictions stopped working on navigation menu items in the previous release of s2Member v150203 due to a default argument value being misinterpreted by a sub-routine. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/475">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Some site owners reported "paying" customers being left with a Membership Level of <code>0</code> at seemingly random times that may have occurred only once in every 300+ transactions. The issue was related to a regular expression being performed against encrypted binary data with an ungreedy <code>?</code> in the regex pattern. Certain characters in the binary output would be lost when specific character sequences were encountered; resulting in a random failure to decrypt cookies set by s2Member. In short, the underlying cause was identified and corrected in this release. Thanks to all who reported this. Our appreciation goes out to everyone who helped to test for this elusive bug. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/397">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>UI Enhancements:</strong> This release includes an enhanced UI, along with many subtle improvements to the inline documentation/instructions provided within the WordPress Dashboard.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Retiring Google Wallet:</strong> Google <a href="https://support.google.com/wallet/business/answer/6107573">announced that they are retiring Google Wallet for Digital Goods</a>. s2Member Pro continues to support Google Wallet, but this release updates the "Other Gateways" section in the Dashboard to make it clear that Google Wallet will not be supported in future versions of s2Member Pro. In fact, Google Wallet for Digital Goods will <a href="https://support.google.com/wallet/business/answer/6107573">close March 2nd, 2015</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member) <strong>bbPress Bug Fix:</strong> This release resolves a security issue when running a Multisite Network with bbPress + s2Member. Level 0 access was being granted by the bbPress plugin across all sites in a network. That behavior is fine for bbPress, but is unexpected when s2Member is running in a Network environment. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/465">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details. <strong>IMPORTANT TIP:</strong> If you experienced this issue, please read through <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/465#issuecomment-76039842">these important comments</a> about bbPress Participants needing to be removed from child blogs in order to fully rid yourself of this problem; i.e., once you complete the update of s2Member, you should <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/465#issuecomment-76039842">also read this please</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>404 / Alt. Views Bug Fix:</strong> This release of s2Member corrects a rare issue where the Membership Options Page (or other pages) can produce random 404 errors whenever s2Member's Alt. View Restrictions are enabled, and there is another plugin installed which runs a DB query using the <code>WP_Query</code> class <em>before</em> the Main WP Query has been run. Resolved through the use of <code>-&#62;is_main_query()</code> instead of tracking it statically via <code>$initial_query</code>.

</ul>

<h4>v150203</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Gift/Redemption Codes:</strong> This release adds a powerful new shortcode: <code>[s2Member-Gift-Codes /]</code>. This makes it easy to generate and sell access to gift codes (i.e., gift certificates) and/or to a list of redemption codes. For instance,  where a single team leader might like to purchase multiple accounts they can distribute to others on a team, or in a group. Video demo here: <a href="http://s2member.com/r/giftredemption-codes-video/" rel="nofollow">http://s2member.com/r/giftredemption-codes-video/</a> ~ See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/386">this GitHub issue</a> for additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>User-Specific Coupon Codes:</strong> This release of s2Member makes it possible to configure Pro-Form Coupon Codes that are connected (i.e., only valid) when entered by specific Users/Members who are logged into the site. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/403">this GitHub issue</a> for additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Max Uses:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro adds the ability to set a maximum number of times that a Coupon Code can be used. This makes it easy to create Coupon Codes that are designed to be used only one time, for instance; or for X number of times. After a Coupon Code is used X number of times, it will expire automatically. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Usage Tracking:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro adds the ability to track the number of times that each of your Coupon Codes have been used. It is also possible to alter the number of uses, and/or set a maximum number of uses. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code Active/Expires Dates:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro makes it possible to establish both a start and end time for each of your Pro Coupon Codes. In previous versions of s2Member, it was only possible to set an expiration date. You can now create Coupon Codes that will become active at some point in the future automatically. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Code UI Enhancements:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro comes with an updated UI that makes it easier to manage your Pro Coupon Codes. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; Pro Coupon Codes</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/285">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Store Coupon Codes for Each User:</strong> s2Member Pro now stores a list of all coupon codes that a customer has used on your site. See: <code>Dashboard &#8594; Users &#8594; Choose User [Edit]</code>. Scrolling down to the set of s2-related fields will reveal a new list of coupon codes. This list will be filled for new customers only; i.e., s2Member does not have this data for past purchases; only for new customers that you acquire after updating to the latest release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/462">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>EOT Custom Value:</strong> In this release of s2Member, the <code>get_user_option('s2member_custom')</code> value is preserved after an EOT has taken place, making it possible for site owners to continue to read this value (along with any custom pipe-delimited values they have injected there), even after an EOT has taken place. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/449">this GitHub issue</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>JW Player Broken Links:</strong> This release corrects some broken links referenced by the inline documentation for s2Member in the WordPress Dashboard. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/448">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Security:</strong> This release of s2Member checks for the existence of the WordPress PHP Constant: <code>WPINC</code> instead of looking for the less reliable <code>$_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']</code>. Some site owners reported this was causing trouble in a localhost environment during testing, or when running s2Member on some hosts that are missing the <code>SCRIPT_FILENAME</code> environment variable; e.g., some Windows servers. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/454">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Advanced Import/Export Compat:</strong> This release of s2Member Pro includes compatibility and a bug fix when running on WordPress v4.1+. Three PHP notices during importation, along with some quirky behavior associated with the <code>role</code> CSV column have been corrected. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/455">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Bug Fix:</strong> This release resolves an issue with pagination in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode after recent improvements to the search functionality. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/155#issuecomment-69403120">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong><code>[s2Member-List /]</code> Enhancement:</strong> This release improves search functionality in the <code>[s2Member-List /]</code> shortcode, making it so that all searches default to <code>*[query]*</code>; i.e., are automatically wrapped by wildcards. If a user enters a wildcard explicitly (or a double quote), this default behavior is overridden and the search query is taken as given in such a scenario. This makes the search functionality easier for end-users to work with, since it no longer requires an exact match. Default behavior is now a fuzzy match. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/394">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>AWS v4 Authentication:</strong> This release of s2Member adds AWS v4 Authentication support for Amazon Web Service Regions that only accept the AWS v4 authentication scheme. If you had trouble in the recent past when attempting to integrate s2Member with S3 Buckets (or with CloudFront) in regions outside the USA, this release should resolve those issues for you. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/440">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Pro-Form Checkout Options not working in all cases whenever they are used together with Free Registration Forms. Resolved in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h4>v150102</h4>

<ul>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Custom Field Mapping:</strong> This release of s2Member adds an internal mapping from s2Member's Custom Field values for each user, to the <code>get_user_option()</code> function in the WordPress core. This makes it possible to retrieve user custom field values like always via <code>get_user_field()</code> or now through the native <code>get_user_option()</code> function also. The benefit of this is that s2Member's custom fields are now more compatible with other themes/plugins for WordPress.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>[s2Member-List /] Shortcode:</strong> It is now possible to search through custom fields created with s2Member using the <code>search_columns=""</code> attribute; e.g., <code>search_columns="user_login,user_email,s2member_custom_field_MYFIELDID"</code>; where <code>MYFIELDID</code> can be replaced with a field ID that you generate with s2Member via <code>Dashboard &#8594; s2Member &#8594; General Options &#8594; Registration/Profile Fields</code>. See also: <a href="http://www.s2member.com/kb/s2member-list-shortcode/">this KB article</a> for further details. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/155">this GitHub issue</a> for details regarding this improvement.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>MailChimp Bug Fix</strong> This release fixes a bug first introduced in the previous release, which was causing Interest Groups configured w/ s2Member to not be added properly. Resolved in this release. Props to @ethanpil Thanks!</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>ccBill Buttons</strong> This release updates all ccBill button graphics. The MasterCard logo has been removed, and a new set of buttons was created to improve upon the set provided in previous versions of s2Member Pro. See: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/392">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net</strong> The <code>AUD</code> currency code is now supported by Authorize.Net, and thus, s2Member Pro has been updated to support the <code>AUD</code> currency code for Pro-Forms integrated with Authorize.Net. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/383">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Subscr. CID for Stripe</strong> This release corrects a bug which made it impossible to update the Subscr. CID value (for Stripe) using the user edit form in the Dashboard. For further details, please see <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/380">this GitHub issue</a>.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug fix</strong> s2Member's membership access times log was failing to collect all required access times under certain scenarios where multiple CCAPS were being added or removed in succession within the same process, but across multiple function calls. This resulted in unexpected behaviors (in rare cases) when attempting to use the <code>[s2Drip /]</code> shortcode. Fixed in this release. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/406">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Compatibility</strong> This release includes a fix for s2Member's Multisite Network patches applied to the <code>wp-admin/user-new.php</code> file whenever you configure s2Member on a Multisite Network. This change makes s2Member compatible with the coming release of WordPress v4.1 and v4.2-beta as it exists now. See: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/410">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> A feature that was previously introduced in v140816, which made it possible for site owners to set a failed payment threshold (in s2Member's Authorize.Net integration), was suffering from an off-by-one issue during total failed payment calculations. Fixed in this release. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/416">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Feature Enhancement:</strong> Whenever a failed payment threshold is reached (in s2Member's Authorize.Net integration), not only will s2Member terminate on-site access, but now the underlying ARB (Automated Recurring Profile) is cancelled at the same exact time. This way future billing attempts on the Authorize.Net side will not be possible; i.e., it ensures that a failed payment threshold will always terminate both on-site access and the ARB itself together at the same time, as opposed to allowing the ARB termination to occur automatically via Authorize.Net, <em>whenever</em>. See also <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/416">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>ClickBank Disclaimer:</strong> This release of s2Member adds a default Auto-Return Header Template (customizable from <code>s2Member &#8594; ClickBank Options</code> in the Dashboard) which includes a disclaimer that ClickBank requires of most merchants before final approval.</p>

<p><em>This default template should help to reduce the time it takes new merchants to receive final approval from ClickBank when first starting out in the ClickBank network. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/412">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</em></p></li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal Pro-Forms for Specific Post/Page Access, and configured with <code>accept="paypal"</code> (i.e., to accept PayPal only) were not hiding the entire Billing Method section as intended. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/399">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like further details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal Pro-Forms using Express Checkout for Billing Agreements under a non-native currency (i.e., under a different currency than their own PayPal account) were failing under some scenarios (notably with the <code>BRL</code> currency code). Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/414">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe API:</strong> s2Member's Stripe integration has been updated to use the new <code>statement_descriptor</code> field in favor of the now deprecated <code>statement_description</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/422">this GitHub issue</a> for technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Bug Fix:</strong> In the case of a global tax rate having been applied to the total cost, there were certain scenarios where s2Member Pro would kick back an error message, "Invalid Parameters to Stripe". Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/425">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li><p>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>WP Core Compat.:</strong> This version of s2Member forces the <code>wptexturize</code> filter off in WordPress, due to a bug that was introduced in recent versions of the WordPress core; which results in broken shortcodes in some scenarios. Until the underlying bug is fixed in the WP core, the <code>wptexturize</code> filter must be disabled to prevent corruption of any WordPress shortcode that may contain <code>&#60;</code> or <code>&#62;</code> symbols.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/349">this GitHub issue</a> for further technical details. Also referencing: <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29608">this WordPress core bug report</a>.</p></li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Alt. Views:</strong> This release fixes a bug that caused <code>wp_list_pages()</code> not to be filtered properly under certain scenarios. A symptom of this bug was to apply s2Member's Alt. View protection for "Pages", but for this not work properly in all cases. Fixed in this release. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/372">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like technical details.</li>
<li>(s2Member/s2Member Pro) <strong>Currency Code/Symbol:</strong> All email templates, API Notifications (except cancellation/EOT notifications), and all Custom Return URLs on Success; across all payment gateways; now support two additional Replacement Codes: <code>%%currency%%</code> and <code>%%currency_symbol%%</code>. See also: <a href="https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/314">this GitHub issue</a> if you'd like additional details.</li>
<li>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Coupon Codes:</strong> All transaction-related email templates now support three additional Replacement Codes: <code>%%full_coupon_code%%</code>, <code>%%coupon_code%%</code>, and <code>%%coupon_affiliate_id%%</code>.

<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Tax Info:</strong> s2Member now attaches metadata to Stripe Charges and to Stripe Subscriptions which includes a JSON-encoded object containing two or more properties when tax applies.</p>

<p>These metadata properties can be found in your Stripe Dashboard with the metadata key: <code>tax_info</code>; which contains the following JSON-encoded properties: <code>tax</code> (total tax that was or will be charged on the regular amount), <code>tax_per</code> (tax percentage rate that was applied based on your configuration of s2Member Pro); along with <code>trial_tax</code> and <code>trial_tax_per</code> in the case of a Stripe Subscription that includes an initial/trial period that requires payment; i.e., the tax applied (if any) to an initial/trial payment on a Subscription.</p>

<p>We hope this additional information being recorded by s2Member and stored securely within your Stripe account will make it easier for you to maintain accurate bookkeeping records moving forward. This additional metadata is generated for new customers only. It will not be backfilled for any past transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Tax Info:</strong> s2Member now passes the tax location; i.e., <code>address_state</code>, <code>address_zip</code>, and <code>address_country</code> to each Stripe Card object associated with a Stripe Customer.</p>

<p>We hope this additional information being recorded by s2Member and stored securely within your Stripe account will make it easier for you to maintain accurate bookkeeping records moving forward. This additional cardholder data is collected and stored for new customers only; it will not be backfilled for any past transactions.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe IP Address:</strong> s2Member now attaches the customer's IP address (as detected via <code>$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']</code> on your server) into each Stripe Customer object, along with the customer's full name. These metadata properties can be found in your Stripe Dashboard with the metadata keys: <code>name</code> and <code>ip</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Coupon Code:</strong> s2Member now attaches metadata w/ a coupon code used by your customer (if applicable) to each Stripe Charge and/or Stripe Subscription object.</p>

After a html file is generated your webserver will serve that file instead of processing the comparatively heavier and more expensive WordPress PHP scripts.</p>

<p>The static html files will be served to the vast majority of your users, but because a user's details are displayed in the comment form after they leave a comment those requests are handled by the legacy caching engine. Static files are served to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Users who are not logged in.</li>
<li>Users who have not left a comment on your blog.</li>
<li>Or users who have not viewed a password protected post.</li>
</ol>

<p>99% of your visitors will be served static html files. Those users who don't see the static files will still benefit because they will see different cached files that aren't quite as efficient but still better than uncached. This plugin will help your server cope with a front page appearance on digg.com or other social networking site.</p>

<p>If for some reason "supercaching" doesn't work on your server then don't worry. Caching will still be performed, but every request will require loading the PHP engine. In normal circumstances this isn't bad at all. Visitors to your site will notice no slowdown or difference. Supercache really comes into it's own if your server is underpowered, or you're experiencing heavy traffic.
Super Cached html files will be served more quickly than PHP generated cached files but in every day use, the difference isn't noticeable.</p>

<p>The plugin serves cached files in 3 ways (ranked by speed):</p>

<ol>
<li>Mod_Rewrite. The fastest method is by using Apache mod_rewrite (or whatever similar module your web server supports) to serve "supercached" static html files. This completely bypasses PHP and is extremely quick. If your server is hit by a deluge of traffic it is more likely to cope as the requests are "lighter". This does require the Apache mod_rewrite module (which is probably installed if you have custom permalinks) and a modification of your .htaccess file. Visits by anonymous or unknown users will be served this way.</li>
<li>PHP. Supercached static files can now be served by PHP. The plugin will serve a "supercached" file if it exists and it's almost as fast as the mod_rewrite method. It's easier to configure as the .htaccess file doesn't need to be changed. You still need a custom permalink. You can keep portions of your page dynamic in this caching mode. Your server may not cope as well with a really large amount of traffic. (You're gaming Digg aren't you? You'll need mod_rewrite, the rest of us are ok with PHP!)</li>
<li>Legacy caching. This is mainly used to cache pages for known users. These are logged in users, visitors who leave comments or those who should be shown custom per-user data. It's the most flexible caching method but also the slowest. As each page is different it's often better not to cache pages for these users at all and avoid legacy caching. Legacy caching will also cache visits by unknown users if this caching mode is selected. You can have dynamic parts to your page in this mode too.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're new to caching use PHP caching. It's easy to set up and very fast. Avoid legacy caching if you can.</p>

<h4>Recommended Settings</h4>

<p>Advanced users will probably want to use mod_rewrite caching, but PHP caching is almost as good and recommended for everyone else. Enable the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>PHP caching.</li>
<li>Compress pages.</li>
<li>Don't cache pages for known users.</li>
<li>Cache rebuild.</li>
<li>CDN support.</li>
<li>Extra homepage checks.</li>
</ol>

<p>Garbage collection is the act of cleaning up cache files that are out of date and stale. There's no correct value for the expiry time but a good starting point is 1800 seconds if you're not using legacy mode. If you are using that mode start with an expiry time of 600 seconds.</p>

<p>If you are not using legacy mode caching consider deleting the contents of the "Rejected User Agents" text box and allow search engines to create supercache static files.</p>

<p>Likewise, preload as many posts as you can and enable "Preload Mode". Garbage collection will still occur but it won't affect the preloaded files. If you don't care about sidebar widgets updating often set the preload interval to 2880 minutes (2 days) so all your posts aren't recached very often. When the preload occurs the cache files for the post being refreshed is deleted and then regenerated. Afterwards a garbage collection of all old files is performed to clean out stale cache files.
With preloading on cached files will still be deleted when posts are made or edited or comments made.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache homepage</a> for further information. <a href="http://z9.io/wp-super-cache-developers/">Developer documentation</a> is also available for those who need to interact with the cache or write plugins.</p>

<p>There's a <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-super-cache">GIT repository</a> too if you want to contribute a patch.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-super-cache/trunk/Changelog.txt">changelog</a> is a good place to start if you want to know what has changed since you last downloaded the plugin.</p>

<p>The cache directory, usually wp-content/cache/ is only for temporary files. Do not ever put important files or symlinks to important files or directories in that directory. They will be deleted if the plugin has write access to them.</p>";s:12:"installation";s:5592:"<ol>
<li>You should have the Apache mod mime and mod rewrite modules installed and WordPress custom permalinks (Settings-&#62;Permalinks) enabled. PHP safe mode should be disabled. If any of those are missing or off you can still use PHP or legacy caching.</li>
<li>If you have WP-Cache installed already, please disable it. Edit wp-config.php and make sure the WP_CACHE and WPCACHEHOME defines are deleted, and remove the files wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and wp-content/advanced-cache.php. These will be recreated when you install this plugin.</li>
<li>Upload this directory to your plugins directory. It will create a 'wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache/' directory.</li>
<li>If you are using WordPress MU or WordPress Multisite you can install the plugin in the ordinary plugins folder and activate it "network wide".</li>
<li>WordPress users should go to their Plugins page and activate "WP Super Cache".</li>
<li>Now go to Settings-&#62;WP Super Cache and enable caching. If you see an error message or a blank screen see the "FAQ" section later in this readme for instructions.</li>
<li><p>If you choose "Mod Rewrite caching", mod_rewrite rules will be inserted into your .htaccess file. Look in your web root directory for this file. It should look similar to this:</p>

<h4>1.2</h4>

<ul>
<li>Garbage collection of old cache files is significantly improved. I added a scheduled job that keeps an eye on things and restarts the job if necessary. Also, if you enable caching from the Easy page garbage collection will be enabled too.</li>
<li>Editors can delete single cached files from the admin bar now.</li>
<li>Fixed the cached page counter on the settings page.</li>
<li>Some sites that updated to 1.0 experienced too much garbage collection. There are still stragglers out there who haven't upgraded but that's fixed now!</li>
<li>Supercached mobile files are now used as there was a tiny little typo that needed fixing.</li>
<li>If your site is in a directory and you saw problems updating a page then that should be fixed now.</li>

</ol>";s:3:"faq";s:21709:"<h4>How do I know my blog is being cached?</h4>

<p>Enable debugging in the plugin settings page and load the log file in a new browser tab. Then view your blog while logged in and logged out. You should see activity in the log. View the source of any page on your site. When a page is first created, you'll see the text "Dynamic page generated in XXXX seconds." and "Cached page generated by WP-Super-Cache on YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" at the end of the source code. On reload, a cached page will show the same timestamp so wait a few seconds before checking. 
In legacy caching mode, if you have compression enabled, the text "Compression = gzip" will be added. If compression is disabled and the page is served as a static html file, the text "super cache" will be added. The only other way to check if your cached file was served by PHP script or from the static cache is by looking at the HTTP headers. PHP cached pages will have the header "WP-Super-Cache: Served supercache file from PHP". Legacy cached files will have the header, "WP-Super-Cache: Served legacy cache file". I used the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3829">Live HTTP Headers</a> extension for Firefox to examine the headers. You should also check your cache directory in wp-content/cache/supercache/hostname/ for static cache files.
If the plugin rules are missing from your .htaccess file, the plugin will attempt to serve the super cached page if it's found. The header "WP-Super-Cache: Served supercache file from PHP" if this happens.</p>

<h4>Legacy (WP-Cache) vs Supercache files</h4>

<p>WP-Cache files are stored in wp-content/cache/ (or on MU sites in a blogs sub directory) and are named wp-cache-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.html. Associated meta files are stored in a meta sub directory. Those files contain information about the cached file. These files are generated by the "legacy caching" code in the plugin.
Supercache files are stored in wp-content/cache/supercache/HOSTNAME/ where HOSTNAME is your domain name. The files are stored in directories matching your site's permalink structure.</p>

<h4>Why is WP-Super-Cache better than WP-Cache?</h4>

<p>This plugin is based on the excellent WP-Cache plugin. Besides the caching WP-Cache did this plugin creates copies of every page that is accessed on a blog in a form that is quickly served by the web server. It's almost as quick as if the you had saved a html page in your browser and uploaded it to replace your homepage.</p>

<h4>Will comments and other dynamic parts of my blog update immediately?</h4>

<p>Comments will show as soon as they are moderated, depending on the comment policy of the blog owner. Other dynamic elements on a page may not update unless they are written in Javascript, Flash, Java or another client side browser language. The plugin really produces static html pages. No PHP is executed when those pages are served. "Popularity Contest" is one such plugin that will not work.</p>

<h4>Will the Super Cache compression slow down my server?</h4>

<p>No, it will do the opposite. Super Cache files are compressed and stored that way so the heavy compression is done only once. These files are generally much smaller and are sent to a visitor's browser much more quickly than uncompressed html. As a result, your server spends less time talking over the network which saves CPU time and bandwidth, and can also serve the next request much more quickly.</p>

<h4>How do I make certain parts of the page stay dynamic?</h4>

<p>Note: this functionality is disabled by default. You will have to enable it on the Advanced Settings page.</p>

<p>There are 2 ways of doing this. You can use Javascript to draw the part of the page you want to keep dynamic. That's what Google Adsense and many widgets from external sites do and is the recommended way. Or you can use a WP Super Cache filter to do the job but you can't use mod_rewrite mode caching. You have to switch to PHP or legacy caching.</p>

<p>WP Super Cache 1.4 introduced a cacheaction filter called wpsc_cachedata. The cached page to be displayed goes through this filter and allows modification of the page. If the page contains a placeholder tag the filter can be used to replace that tag with your dynamically generated html.
The function that hooks on to the wpsc_cachedata filter should be put in a file in the WP Super Cache plugins folder unless you use the late_init feature. An example plugin is included. Edit <a href="http://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-super-cache/trunk/plugins/dynamic-cache-test.php">dynamic-cache-test.php</a> to see the example code.
There are two example functions there. There's a simple function that replaces a string (or tag) you define when the cached page is served. The other example function uses an output buffer to generate the dynamic content. Due to a limitation in how PHP works the output buffer code MUST run before the wpsc_cachedata filter is hit, at least for when a page is cached. It doesn't matter when serving cached pages. See <a href="http://z9.io/y/6j">this post</a> for a more technical and longer explanation.
To execute WordPress functions you must enable the 'Late init' feature on the advanced settings page.</p>

<h4>How do I use WordPress functions in cached dynamic pages?</h4>

<h4>How do I delay serving the cache until the "init" action fires?</h4>

<p>Cached files are served before almost all of WordPress is loaded. While that's great for performance it's a pain when you want to extend the plugin using a core part of WordPress. Enable 'Late init' mode on the Advanced settings page and cached files will be served when "init" fires. WordPress and it's plugins will be loaded now.</p>

<h4>Why don't WP UserOnline, Popularity Contest, WP Postratings or plugin X not work or update on my blog now?</h4>

<p>This plugin caches entire pages but some plugins think they can run PHP code every time a page loads. To fix this, the plugin needs to use Javascript/AJAX methods or the wpsc_cachedata filter described in the previous answer to update or display dynamic information.</p>

<h4>Why do my WP Super Cache plugin disappear when I upgrade the plugin?</h4>

<p>WordPress deletes the plugin folder when it updates a plugin. This is the same with WP Super Cache so any modified files in wp-super-cache/plugins/ will be deleted. You can define the variable $wp_cache_plugins_dir in wp-config.php or wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and point it at a directory outside of the wp-super-cache folder. The plugin will look there for it's plugins.</p>

<h4>What does the Cache Rebuild feature do?</h4>

<p>When a visitor leaves a comment the cached file for that page is deleted and the next visitor recreates the cached page. A page takes time to load so what happens if it receives 100 visitors during this time? There won't be a cached page so WordPress will serve a fresh page for each user and the plugin will try to create a cached page for each of those 100 visitors causing a huge load on your server. This feature stops this happening. The cached page is not cleared when a comment is left. It is marked for rebuilding instead. The next visitor within the next 10 seconds will regenerate the cached page while the old page is served to the other 99 visitors. The page is eventually loaded by the first visitor and the cached page updated. See <a href="http://z9.io/2009/01/23/wp-super-cache-089/">this post</a> for more.</p>

<h4>Why doesn't the plugin cache requests by search engine bots by default?</h4>

<p>Those bots usually only visit each page once and if the page is not popular there's no point creating a cache file that will sit idle on your server. However if you're not using legacy caching you can allow these visits to be cached by removing the list of bots from "Rejected User Agents" on the Advanced settings page.</p>

<h4>A category page is showing instead of my homepage</h4>

<p>A tiny proportion of websites will have problems with the following configuration:</p>

<ol>
<li>Uses a static page for the front page.</li>
<li>Uses /%category%/%postname%/ permalink structure.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes a category page is cached as the homepage of the site instead of the static page. I can't <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/237415/page/2?replies=38">replicate the problem</a> but a simple solution is to switch the plugin to PHP mode. For normal traffic you will see no difference in the speed of your site. You can also enable "Extra homepage checks" on the Advanced Settings page.</p>

<h4>Why do I get warnings about caching from <a href="http://ismyblogworking.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ismyblogworking.com/</a></h4>

<p>"Your blog doesn't support client caching (no 304 response to If-modified-since)."
"Your feed doesn't support caching (no 304 response to If-modified-since)"</p>

<p>Supercache doesn't support 304 header checks in mod_rewrite mode but does support it in PHP mode. This is caching done by your browser, not the server. It is a check your browser does to ask the server if an updated version of the current page is available. If not, it doesn't download the old version again. The page is still cached by your server, just not by your visitors' browsers.
Try the Cacheability Engine at <a href="http://www.ircache.net/cgi-bin/cacheability.py" rel="nofollow">http://www.ircache.net/cgi-bin/cacheability.py</a> or <a href="http://redbot.org/" rel="nofollow">http://redbot.org/</a> for further analysis.</p>

<h4>How should I best use the utm_source tracking tools in Google Analytics with this plugin?</h4>

<p>That tracking adds a query string to each url linked from various sources like Twitter and feedreaders. Unfortunately it stops pages being supercached. See <a href="http://z9.io/remove-unused-utmsource-urls/#comment-672813">Joost's comment here</a> for how to turn it into an anchor tag which can be supercached.</p>

<h4>The plugin complains that wp-content is writable! htdocs is writable!</h4>

<p>It's not good when the web server can write to these directories but sometimes shared hosting accounts are set up in this way to make administration easier. Use <code>chmod 755 directory</code> to fix the permissions or find the permissions section of your ftp client. This <a href="http://www.google.ie/search?sourceid=chrome&#38;ie=UTF-8&#38;q=ftp+fix+directory+permissions+755">Google search</a> will lead you to more information on this topic and there's also <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions">this codex page</a> too. Unfortunately some hosts require that those directories be writable. If that's the case just ignore this warning.</p>

<h4>How do I delete the WP_CACHE define from wp-config.php?</h4>

<p>Load your desktop ftp client and connect to your site. Navigate to the root (or the directory below it) of your site where you'll find wp-config.php. Download that file and edit it in a text editor. Delete the line <code>define( 'WP_CACHE', true );</code> and save the file. Now upload it, overwriting the wp-config.php on your server.</p>

<h4>How do I delete the Super Cache rules from the .htaccess file?</h4>

<p>Load your desktop ftp client and connect to your site. You may need to enable "Show hidden files" in the preferences of the ftp client. Navigate to the root of your site where you'll find the .htaccess file. Download that file and edit it in a text editor. Delete the lines between "# BEGIN WPSuperCache" and "# END WPSuperCache" and save the file. Now upload it, overwriting the .htaccess file on your server.</p>

<h4>How do I change file permissions?</h4>

<p>This <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions">page</a> on the WordPress Codex explains everything you need to know about file permissions on your server and various ways of changing them.</p>

<h4>Why do I get load spikes when new posts are made?</h4>

<p>You may have the "clear all cached files when new posts are made" option set. Clearing those files can take time plus your visitors will now be visiting uncached pages. Are you using Google Analytics campaign tracking with utm_source in the url? Those pages aren't cached. See the question, "How should I best use the utm_source tracking tools in Google Analytics with this plugin" above for how to use them properly.
Cached pages have to be refreshed when posts are made. Perhaps your server just isn't up to the job of serving the amount of traffic you get. Enable the "cache rebuild" feature as that may help.</p>

<h4>How many pages can I cache?</h4>

<p>The only real limit are limits defined by your server. For example, EXT2 and EXT3 allow a maximum of 31,999 sub directories so if you have a flat permalink structure (like /%POSTNAME%/) and more than 32,000 posts you may run into problems. Likewise, if you run a multisite network and have more than 31,999 sites (blogs) you won't be able to cache all of them. Realistically if you had that many active sites you wouldn't be running on one server.</p>

<h4>How do I serve cached mobile pages to clients on small screens like phones and tablets?</h4>

<p>You'll have to use a separate mobile plugin to render a page formatted for those visitors. The following plugins have been tested but YMMV depending on mobile client.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack">Jetpack's Mobile Theme Module</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wptouch/">WPTouch</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mobile-edition/">WordPress Mobile Edition</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack/">WordPress Mobile Pack</a> (can't have "Don't cache pages for known users." enabled)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

<p>If things don't work when you installed the plugin here are a few things to check:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is wp-content writable by the web server?</li>
<li>Is there a wp-content/wp-cache-config.php ? If not, copy the file wp-super-cache/wp-cache-config-sample.php to wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and make sure WPCACHEHOME points at the right place.</li>
<li>Is there a wp-content/advanced-cache.php ? If not, then you must copy wp-super-cache/advanced-cache.php into wp-content/. You must edit the file and change the path so it points at the wp-super-cache folder.</li>
<li>If pages are not cached at all, remove wp-content/advanced-cache.php and recreate it, following the advice above.</li>
<li><p>Make sure the following line is in wp-config.php and it is ABOVE the "require_once(ABSPATH.'wp-settings.php');" line:</p>

<p><code>define( 'WP_CACHE', true );</code></p></li>
<li>Try the Settings-&#62;WP Super Cache page again and enable cache.</li>
<li>Look in wp-content/cache/supercache/. Are there directories and files there?</li>
<li>Anything in your php error_log?</li>
<li>If your browser keeps asking you to save the file after the super cache is installed you must disable Super Cache compression. Go to the Settings-&#62;WP Super Cache page and disable it there.</li>
<li>The plugin does not work very well when PHP's safe mode is active. This must be disabled by your administrator.</li>
<li>If pages are randomly super cached and sometimes not, your blog can probably be viewed with and without the "www" prefix on the URL. You should choose one way and install the <a href="http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/enforce-www-preference/">Enforce www preference</a> plugin if you are using an old WordPress install. The latest versions redirect themselves (you should always be running the latest version of WordPress anyway!)</li>
<li>Private Server users at Dreamhost should edit wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and set the cache dir to "/tmp/" if they are getting errors about increasing CPU usage. See this <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/145895?replies=42">discussion</a> for more.</li>
<li>File locking errors such as "failed to acquire key 0x152b: Permission denied in..." or "Page not cached by WP Super Cache. Could not get mutex lock." are a sign that you may have to use file locking. Edit wp-content/wp-cache-config.php and uncomment "$use_flock = true" or set $sem_id to a different value. You can also disable file locking from the Admin screen as a last resort.</li>
<li>Make sure cache/wp_cache_mutex.lock is writable by the web server if using coarse file locking.</li>
<li>The cache folder cannot be put on an NFS or Samba or NAS share. It has to be on a local disk. File locking and deleting expired files will not work properly unless the cache folder is on the local machine.</li>
<li><p>Garbage collection of old cache files won't work if WordPress can't find wp-cron.php. If your hostname resolves to 127.0.0.1 it could be preventing the garbage collection from working. Check your access_logs for wp-cron.php entries. Do they return a 404 (file not found) or 200 code? If it's 404 or you don't see wp-cron.php anywhere WordPress may be looking for that script in the wrong place. You should speak to your server administator to correct this or edit /etc/hosts on Unix servers and remove the following line. Your hostname must resolve to the external IP address other servers on the network/Internet use. See <a href="http://yoast.com/wp-cron-issues/" rel="nofollow">http://yoast.com/wp-cron-issues/</a> for more. A line like "127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain" is ok.</p>

<p><code>127.0.0.1 myhostname.com</code></p></li>
<li>If old pages are being served to your visitors via the supercache, you may be missing Apache modules (or their equivalents if you don't use Apache). 3 modules are required: mod_mime, mod_headers and mod_expires. The last two are especially important for making sure browsers load new versions of existing pages on your site.</li>
<li>The error message, "WP Super Cache is installed but broken. The path to wp-cache-phase1.php in wp-content/advanced-cache.php must be fixed!" appears at the end of every page. Open the file wp-content/advanced-cache.php in your favourite editor. Is the path to wp-cache-phase1.php correct? This file will normally be in wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache/. If it is not correct the caching engine will not load.</li>
<li>Caching doesn't work. The timestamp on my blog keeps changing when I reload. Check that the path in your .htaccess rules matches where the supercache directory is. You may have to hardcode it. Or use the plugin in PHP or legacy caching mode.</li>
<li><p>If supercache cache files are generated but not served, check the permissions on all your wp-content/cache/supercache folders (and each of wp-content cache and supercache folders) and wp-content/cache/.htaccess. If your PHP runs as a different user to Apache and permissions are strict Apache may not be able to read the PHP generated cache files. To fix you must add the following line to your wp-config.php (Add it above the WP_CACHE define.) Then clear your cache.</p>

<p><code>umask( 0022 );</code></p></li>
<li><p>If you see garbage in your browser after enabling compression in the plugin, compression may already be enabled in your web server. In Apache you must disable mod_deflate, or in PHP zlib compression may be enabled. You can disable that in three ways. If you have root access, edit your php.ini and find the zlib.output_compression setting and make sure it's "Off" or add this line to your .htaccess:</p>

<p><code>php_flag zlib.output_compression off</code>
If that doesn't work, add this line to your wp-config.php:</p>

<p><code>ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 0);</code></p></li>
<li>The "white screen of death" or a blank page  when you visit your site is almost always caused by a PHP error but <a href="http://www.johnberns.com/2010/03/19/wp-super-cache-blank-page-problem-fixed/">it may also be caused by APC</a>. Disable that PHP extension if you have trouble and replace with eAccelerator or Xcache.</li>
<li>After uninstalling, your permalinks may break if you remove the WordPress mod_rewrite rules too. Regenerate those rules by visiting the Settings-&#62;Permalink page and saving that form again.</li>
<li>If your blog refuses to load make sure your wp-config.php is correct. Are you missing an opening or closing PHP tag?</li>
<li>Your front page is ok but posts and pages give a 404? Go to Settings-&#62;permalinks and click "Save" once you've selected a custom permalink structure. You may need to manually update your .htaccess file.</li>
<li><p>If certain characters do not appear correctly on your website your server may not be configured correctly. You need to tell visitors what character set is used. Go to Settings-&#62;Reading and copy the 'Encoding for pages and feeds' value. Edit the .htaccess file with all your Supercache and WordPress rewrite rules and add this at the top, replacing CHARSET with the copied value. (for example, 'UTF-8')</p>

<p><code>AddDefaultCharset CHARSET</code></p></li>
<li>Use <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/cron-view/">Cron View</a> to help diagnose garbage collection and preload problems. Use the plugin to make sure jobs are scheduled and for what time. Look for the wp_cache_gc and wp_cache_full_preload_hook jobs.</li>
<li>The error message, "WP Super Cache is installed but broken. The constant WPCACHEHOME must be set in the file wp-config.php and point at the WP Super Cache plugin directory." appears at the end of every page. You can delete wp-content/advanced-cache.php and reload the plugin settings page or edit wp-config.php and look for WPCACHEHOME and make sure it points at the wp-super-cache folder. This will normally be wp-content/plugins/wp-super-cache/ but you'll likely need the full path to that file (so it's easier to let the settings page fix it). If it is not correct the caching engine will not load.</li>
</ol>";s:11:"other_notes";s:5803:"<h3>How to uninstall WP Super Cache</h3>
<p>Almost all you have to do is deactivate the plugin on the plugins page. The plugin should clean up most of the files it created and modified, but it doesn't as yet remove the mod_rewrite rules from the .htaccess file. Look for the section in that file marked by SuperCache BEGIN and END tags. The plugin doesn't remove those because some people add the WordPress rules in that block too.</p>

<p>To manually uninstall:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn off caching on the plugin settings page and clear the cache.</li>
<li>Deactivate the plugin on the plugins page.</li>
<li>Remove the WP_CACHE define from wp-config.php. It looks like <code>define( 'WP_CACHE', true );</code></li>
<li>Remove the Super Cache mod_rewrite rules from your .htaccess file.</li>
<li>Remove the files wp-content/advanced-cache.php and wp-content/wp-cache-config.php</li>
<li>Remove the directory wp-content/cache/</li>
<li>Remove the directory wp-super-cache from your plugins directory.</li>
</ol>
<h3>If all else fails and your site is broken</h3>
<ol>
<li>Remove the WP_CACHE define from wp-config.php. It looks like <code>define( 'WP_CACHE', true );</code></li>
<li>Remove the rules (see above) that the plugin wrote to the .htaccess file in your root directory.</li>
<li>Delete the wp-super-cache folder in the plugins folder.</li>
<li>Optionally delete advanced-cache.php, wp-cache-config.php and the cache folder in wp-content/.</li>
</ol>
<h3>CDN</h3>
<p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is usually a network of computers situated around the world that will serve the content of your website faster by using servers close to you. Static files like images, Javascript and CSS files can be served through these networks to speed up how fast your site loads. You can also create a "poor man's CDN" by using a sub domain of your domain to serve static files too.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/ossdl-cdn-off-linker/">OSSDL CDN off-linker</a> has been integrated into WP Super Cache to provide basic CDN support. It works by rewriting the URLs of files (excluding .php files) in wp-content and wp-includes on your server so they point at a different hostname. Many CDNs support <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;q=%22origin+pull%22">origin pull</a>. This means the CDN will download the file automatically from your server when it's first requested, and will continue to serve it for a configurable length of time before downloading it again from your server.</p>

<p>Configure this on the "CDN" tab of the plugin settings page. This is an advanced technique and requires a basic understanding of how your webserver or CDNs work. Please be sure to clear the file cache after you configure the CDN.</p>
<h3>Custom Caching</h3>
<p>It is now possible to hook into the caching process using the add_cacheaction() function.</p>

<p>Three hooks are available:</p>

<ol>
<li>'wp_cache_get_cookies_values' - modify the key used by WP Cache.</li>
<li>'add_cacheaction' - runs in phase2. Allows a plugin to add WordPress hooks.</li>
<li>'cache_admin_page' - runs in the admin page. Use it to modify that page, perhaps by adding new configuration options.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is one regular WordPress filter too. Use the "do_createsupercache" filter 
to customize the checks made before caching. The filter accepts one parameter. 
The output of WP-Cache's wp_cache_get_cookies_values() function.</p>

<p>See plugins/searchengine.php as an example I use for my <a href="http://z9.io/no-adverts-for-friends/">No Adverts for Friends</a> plugin.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-widget-cache/">WP Widget Cache</a> is another caching plugin for WordPress. This plugin caches the output of widgets and may significantly speed up dynamic page generation times.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>Updates to the plugin will be posted here, to <a href="http://z9.io/">Holy Shmoly!</a> and the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache homepage</a> will always link to the newest version.</p>
<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>I would sincerely like to thank <a href="http://onemansblog.com/">John Pozadzides</a> for giving me the idea for this, for writing the "How it works" section and for testing the plugin through 2 front page appearances on digg.com</p>

<p>Thanks to James Farmer and Andrew Billits of <a href="http://edublogs.org/">Edu Blogs</a> fame who helped me make this more WordPress MU friendly.</p>

<p>Translators who did a great job converting the text of the plugin to their native language. Thank you!</p>

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.3.1 also fixes twenty-six bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.3.1">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.3/?rev=34199&amp;stop_rev=33647">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.3.1</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.3.1.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard.

<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.4">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33573&amp;stop_rev=33396">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.4</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.4.</p>
<p><em>Already testing WordPress 4.3? The second release candidate is now available (<a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-RC2.zip">zip</a>) and it contains these fixes.

<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version.

<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.3.1 also fixes twenty-six bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.3.1">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.3/?rev=34199&amp;stop_rev=33647">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.3.1</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.3.1.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard.

<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.4">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33573&amp;stop_rev=33396">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.4</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.4.</p>
<p><em>Already testing WordPress 4.3? The second release candidate is now available (<a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-RC2.zip">zip</a>) and it contains these fixes.

<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version.

<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Site icons for all</em><br />

	<title>Donncha: The Web Won’t Forget Alex King</title>
	<guid>http://z9.io/?p=89499737</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you use a WordPress site, either as a visitor or owner, you&amp;#8217;re using code that &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/&quot;&gt;Alex King&lt;/a&gt;, one of the original developers of WordPress, worked on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He passed away after fighting &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;cancer for 2 years&lt;/a&gt; but his online presence lives on in the form of his blog with it&amp;#8217;s deep archive of posts going back years, and in so much code that it&amp;#8217;s humbling to look at his &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/projects&quot;&gt;projects page&lt;/a&gt;. Looking through the svn log of WordPress trunk shows he still had a hand in helping the WordPress project until relatively recently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;trunk$ svn log|grep alexkingorg&lt;br /&gt;
props alexkingorg for the initial, long-suffering patch.&lt;br /&gt;
props alexkingorg. fixes &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24162&quot;&gt;#24162&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Props alexkingorg&lt;br /&gt;
`wp.media` instead of just `media`. props alexkingorg, see #22676.&lt;br /&gt;
Add $post_ID context to the pre_ping filter. props alexkingorg, devesine. fixes #18506.&lt;br /&gt;
Add filter so the users can select custom image sizes added by themes and plugins, props alexkingorg, fixes #18520&lt;br /&gt;
esc_textarea() and application for obvious textarea escaping. props alexkingorg. fixes #15454&lt;br /&gt;
Escape links by default.  Props alexkingorg. see #13051&lt;br /&gt;
Safely include class-json.php, class-simplepie.php and class-snoopy.php, props alexkingorg, fixes #11827&lt;br /&gt;
Fix user creation from admin after changes for #10751. Fixes #10811 props alexkingorg.&lt;br /&gt;
Hooks needed to allow alternate category admin inteface. Props alexkingorg. fixes #3408&lt;br /&gt;
Wrap cat name in CDATA. props alexkingorg.  fixes #3252&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sorry I never met Alex, however I remember working virtually with him and Adam Tow on AllThingsD which seems like a lifetime away now. Adam has &lt;a href=&quot;http://tow.com/2015/09/28/remembering-alex-king/&quot;&gt;a great article&lt;/a&gt; on Alex on his blog, as does Matt &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2015/09/remembering-alex-king/&quot;&gt;who went into detail&lt;/a&gt; about Alex&amp;#8217;s involvement with WordPress going back to the days of b2. I had completely forgotten &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition&quot;&gt;the CSS competition&lt;/a&gt; he mentioned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex, your legacy lives on. &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress 4.4 Removes the View Post and Get Shortlink Buttons From the Post Editor</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;In WordPress 4.4, the View Post button in the post editor is disappearing in favor of a clickable permalink. Four years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scribu.net/&quot;&gt;Scribu&lt;/a&gt;, who is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scribu.net/blog/left-wordpress.html&quot;&gt;former WordPress contributor&lt;/a&gt;, created ticket &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18306&quot;&gt;#18306&lt;/a&gt;. In the ticket, Scribu explains that the View Post button is redundant functionality and suggests that it be removed in favor of a clickable permalink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two screenshots of the post editor. The first is WordPress 4.3 and the second is WordPress 4.4. Clicking the permalink allows you to preview the post in its current state. Notice the slug part of the URL is in bold. You need to click the Edit button to edit the permalink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WP43PermalinkEditor.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-48397 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WP43PermalinkEditor.png?resize=568%2C213&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.3 Post Editor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Post Editor
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WP44PermalinkEditor.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-48398 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WP44PermalinkEditor.png?resize=570%2C188&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.4 Post Editor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.4 Post Editor
&lt;p&gt;Not only does this change remove redundant functionality, it removes a UI element from the page. Enhancements like these are a huge win for WordPress because it makes the interface simpler without permanently removing the button&amp;#8217;s purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the View Post button, the Get Shortlink button is also removed. The button shows up if you’re using a custom shortlink and can be re-enabled using code or a plugin. For most users, the Edit button is the only one they&amp;#8217;ll see between the post title and content box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect some users will be frustrated as they go through the process of changing their workflow but overall, I think it&amp;#8217;s a great improvement. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/&quot;&gt;WordPress beta testing plugin&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Westwood, I encourage you to set it to bleeding edge nightlies and update your site. You&amp;#8217;ll be able to test this change and others during the WordPress 4.4 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Remembering Alex King</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45372</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/09/remembering-alex-king/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2009/05/wordcamp-sf-2009-2/mcm_0235-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2009/05/MCM_0235.JPG?resize=276%2C415&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alex speaking at WordCamp SF 2009One of the original WordPress developers, Alex King, has passed &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;from cancer&lt;/a&gt; at far too young an age. Alex actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2002/10/24/b2-coding&quot;&gt;got involved with b2 in 2002&lt;/a&gt; and was active in the forums and the &amp;#8220;hacks&amp;#8221; community there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex had a background as a designer before he learned development, and I think that really came through as he was one of those rare people who thought about the design and usability of his code, the opposite of most development that drifts toward entropy and complexity. One of my favorite things about Alex was how &lt;em&gt;darn tasteful&lt;/em&gt; he was. He would think about every aspect of something he built, every place someone could click, every path they could go down, and gave a thoughtfulness to these paths that I still admire and envy today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example look&amp;nbsp;at his &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/project/post-formats-admin-ui&quot;&gt;project page (essentially a category archive) for the Post Formats Admin UI&lt;/a&gt;, isn&amp;#8217;t that clever and intuitive how the posts connect together, and when more time passes in the thread it&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudup.com/ceWJeb9zcK6&quot;&gt;shown as a break&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s classic Alex: something simple and thoughtful that in hindsight is so gobsmackingly obvious you wonder why everything doesn&amp;#8217;t work that way, but you never would have imagined it beforehand. And Alex wouldn&amp;#8217;t just imagine it and do it for himself, he released his best work as open source, as a gift to the community and the world, over and over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when WordPress was getting started Alex was a celebrity of the b2 world, his hacks (plugins before plugins) were&amp;nbsp;some of the coolest ones around. We had a ton of overlapping interests in web standards, photography, development, and gadgets so&amp;nbsp;we frequently read and commented on each other&amp;#8217;s blogs. I would never miss a post on his site, and that&amp;#8217;s back when we were both doing one or more posts a day. To get a sense of Alex it&amp;#8217;s worth &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog&quot;&gt;exploring his blog&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; he was a clear thinker and therefore a clear writer.&amp;nbsp;The straightforward nature Alex wrote with was something I always admired about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2003/07/08/wordpress-development&quot;&gt;discussed WordPress early on&lt;/a&gt;, Alex &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2003/07/23/wordpress-hacks&quot;&gt;signed up to help with what later became the plugin directory&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition&quot;&gt;his CSS competition&lt;/a&gt; (look at those prizes! and notice it&amp;#8217;s all GPL) was hugely influential on the path to themes, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2003/08/15/wordpress-dev&quot;&gt;he officially became a contributing developer in August of 2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of what Alex was one of the first to do in the WordPress community is long, and &lt;em&gt;in hindsight&lt;/em&gt; seems gobsmackingly obvious, which is the sign of innovation. I smile when I think of how he &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2003/10/02/moving-to-denver&quot;&gt;moved from the Bay area to Denver&lt;/a&gt; before it was cool, or his &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudup.com/cL9v2RKEI0T&quot;&gt;love of scare quotes&lt;/a&gt;. Once there was something going on in WordPress and he called me to talk about it, I was so surprised, he said the number was right on my contact page (and it was) but even though it had been there for years no one had ever called it before, but that was just the type of person Alex was, always reaching out and connecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://atow.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2007-04-16_2122-18_8683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adam Tow, myself, Barry Abrahamson, Alex King; Photo from &lt;a href=&quot;http://tow.com/2015/09/28/remembering-alex-king/&quot;&gt;Adam Tow&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure how to include this next part: I couldn&amp;#8217;t write last night &amp;#8212; I was too tired. After falling&amp;nbsp;asleep I had one of those super vivid dreams that you can&amp;#8217;t tell are dreams. There had been some sort of mix-up on Twitter and Alex was still alive, I&amp;nbsp;visited Colorado with my sister and saw him surrounded by family at a picnic table, all the rooms were taken so they put me on a floor mattress where I slept. Tons of his friends were around and we took pictures together, he was excited about the better front&amp;nbsp;camera on the 6s+. (Alex understood&amp;nbsp;mobile all the way back to the Treo days.) It was all very ordinary and in a group setting, until we decided to walk alongside a small highway, past some grain silos, to meet the group at a bar. The walk was just the two of us and we talked and&amp;nbsp;laughed about the big mix-up and he asked about this post, what was going to be in it. He got most excited and emphatic with the part about him being a developer with great taste, and a clear writer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.williamzinsserwriter.com/&quot;&gt;William Zinsser&lt;/a&gt; would be proud of, so I like to think that those were two things he was proud of. The overwhelming emotion I remember was joy. Waking up was disconcerting, part of me wants to believe part of Alex&amp;#8217;s spirit was there, where another more logical part thinks my mind was&amp;nbsp;just going through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model&quot;&gt;the denial stage of grief&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless I know that Alex will stay in the minds of people who knew him for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code that Alex wrote still runs billions of times a day across millions of websites, and long after that code evolves or gets refactored the ideas and philosophy he embedded in WordPress will continue to be part of who we are. Alex believed so deeply in open source, and was one of the few people from a design background who did. (Every time you see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_icon&quot;&gt;the share icon&lt;/a&gt; on the web or in Android you should think of him.) I like the idea that part of his work will&amp;nbsp;continue in software for decades to come, but I&amp;#8217;d rather have him here, thinking outside the box and challenging us to do better, to be more obvious, and work harder for our users. He never gave up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Alex King, Founder of Crowd Favorite Passes Away</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48380</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/alex-king-founder-of-crowd-favorite-passes-away</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AlexKingWithDaughter.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48381&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AlexKingWithDaughter.jpg?resize=620%2C360&quot; alt=&quot;Alex King with his daughter Heather&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alex King with his daughter Caitlin
&lt;p&gt;Alex King, who founded web development agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://crowdfavorite.com/&quot;&gt;Crowd Favorite,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/alexkingorg/&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of several WordPress themes and plugins &lt;a href=&quot;http://tow.com/2015/09/28/remembering-alex-king/&quot;&gt;passed away last night&lt;/a&gt; at his home. In January 2013, King was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer. He used his blog to tell the &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;story of his fight to stay alive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 24th, King &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/cycle-1-of-new-trial&quot;&gt;finished the first cycle&lt;/a&gt; of a new clinical trial that he says went well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m nearly through my first cycle of the new clinical trial and overall I think it’s gone pretty well. I was able to get the 6 pills/day (3 in the morning, 3 in the evening) without too much concern. That said, by the end of the 5 days taking the pills I would basically sleep for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same day, he published what would be his &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances&quot;&gt;final request&lt;/a&gt; to the WordPress community. King requested that anyone with memories of him and his career to submit them to his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as “dad”, but when she gets older she’ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any memories of King, please honor his request and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/contact&quot;&gt;submit them&lt;/a&gt; to his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outpouring of Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the news of King&amp;#8217;s death spread throughout the community, many shared grief on Twitter while others reflected on his accomplishments in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Most &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordPress&lt;/a&gt; users will never know how important &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexkingorg&quot;&gt;@alexkingorg&lt;/a&gt; was to our CMS. A great loss to the community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JPtI3gMfE7&quot;&gt;https://t.co/JPtI3gMfE7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;King&amp;#8217;s Impact on WordPress Early On&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King is one of a handful of people who witnessed the transition &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Content/Part%201/2-b2-cafelog.md&quot;&gt;from b2 to WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. He&amp;#8217;s one of the earliest WordPress developers and is largely credited with motivating developers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Content/Part%203/12-themes.md&quot;&gt;build themes&lt;/a&gt; using the template engine in WordPress 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex King wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/20/wordpress-css-style-switcher&quot;&gt;CSS Style Switcher&lt;/a&gt; hack, which came with three CSS stylesheets. Not everyone who had a WordPress blog wanted to create their own stylesheet, and many didn’t know how. Users needed a pool of stylesheets to choose from. To grow the number of stylesheets available, Alex ran a WordPress &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition&quot;&gt;CSS Style competition&lt;/a&gt;. Prizes, donated by members of the community, were offered for the top three stylesheets; $70, $35, and $10 respectively. &amp;#8211; WordPress History Book&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first contest, King received 38 submissions with Pink Lillies by Naoko Takano winning first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pink-lillies.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-48383&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pink-lillies.png?resize=500%2C300&quot; alt=&quot;Pink Lillies Wins First Design Contest&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pink Lillies Wins First Design Contest
&lt;p&gt;Each sylesheet submitted to the contest was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/styles&quot;&gt;available to the public&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, King&amp;#8217;s website was an early version of the WordPress theme directory. In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2005/02/27/wordpress-theme-competition&quot;&gt;second contest&lt;/a&gt;, he received over 100 submissions. In total, King hosted 138 themes on his site. He decided not to host the competition again in 2006 due to the sheer amount of work required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appearances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King appeared on several different WordPress podcasts and spoke at a number of WordCamps. Here are links to a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Memorable Experience With Alex King&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I spoke to King in person was at WordCamp San Francisco 2013. A group of us rode together in a party limo complete with blinking lights inside. I sat across from him and asked a few questions related to his health. I also asked him about the early days of WordPress. King was a soft-spoken man who at times is hard to hear but it turned out to be a great and memorable conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WordPress community has lost an inspirational person and a pillar of the WordPress project. My deepest condolences go out to his friends and family. King is survived by his wife Heather and his daughter Caitlin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: Rest in peace, Alex King</title>

	<link>https://poststatus.com/alex-king/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prototypical WordPress developer and blogger, Alex King was a tremendously influential member of the WordPress ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was one of a very small group of people involved during the transition of b2 to WordPress. He helped to create the website that would become the first WordPress.com VIP client. He started the first WordPress-centric consulting agency. He was fundamental to the development and direction of dozens of WordPress features. He even created a small icon that would go on to become the ubiquitous &amp;#8220;share icon&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex was a selfless contributor, a driven entrepreneur, and a friend to many. He was also a husband to Heather and a father to Caitlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to web work, Alex loved golf and photography. His blog is an outstanding example of the art, where he logged his story, his passions, and his challenges. I could not possibly tell his story better &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/about&quot;&gt;than he himself can&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress 4.4 to Possibly Rearrange Fields to the Comment Form</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48365</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-4-to-possibly-rearrange-fields-to-the-comment-form</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress plugin and theme developers need to take note of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/25/changes-to-fields-output-by-comment_form-in-wordpress-4-4/&quot;&gt;important change in WordPress 4.4&lt;/a&gt; that rearranges the comment form. In WordPress 4.4, the comment form is arranged so that the text area is displayed first followed by the name, email, and website fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentsFirst.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48366&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentsFirst.png?resize=1024%2C992&quot; alt=&quot;Comment Text Area is First&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Comment Text Area is First
&lt;p&gt;According to Aaron Jorbin, WordPress core developer, the change improves navigation when using the keyboard to toggle through fields. It also makes it easier for users to leave comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the change requires filters and actions to run in a different order, the HTML output by &lt;code&gt;comment_form&lt;/code&gt; will be different. Jorbin explains that if developers use any of the hooks inside &lt;code&gt;comment_form&lt;/code&gt;, especially &lt;code&gt;comment_form_field_comment&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;comment_form_after_fields&lt;/code&gt;, developers should test their themes and plugins using &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/download/nightly/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.4 nightlies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run into any problems or inconsistencies, please report them to&lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29974&quot;&gt; ticket #29974&lt;/a&gt;. What do you think of the change? Do you think readers want to write their comment first instead of filling out the other three fields?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordCampus Renames Event to WPCampus</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48351</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordcampus-renames-event-to-wpcampus</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WPCampusFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48353&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WPCampusFeaturedImage.png?resize=811%2C161&quot; alt=&quot;WPCampus Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordcampus-a-conference-devoted-to-using-wordpress-in-higher-education&quot;&gt;WordCampus was announced&lt;/a&gt;, some of our readers &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordcampus-a-conference-devoted-to-using-wordpress-in-higher-education#comment-72098&quot;&gt;expressed concern&lt;/a&gt; that the event&amp;#8217;s name is too similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/&quot;&gt;WordCamp US&lt;/a&gt; and would cause confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also concern that without being officially sanctioned by WordCamp Central, the event would infringe the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/&quot;&gt;WordCamp trademark&lt;/a&gt; that is owned and protected by the WordPress Foundation. To alleviate these concerns, the organizing group changed the name from WordCampus to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;WPCampus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel Carden, one of the event&amp;#8217;s primary organizers, says the team had a backup plan from day one, &amp;#8220;While most of the community agreed that the name WordCampus was spot on, the possibility of changing our name was proposed from day one as WordCampus was being confused with WordCamp US,&amp;#8221; Carden said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As much as we love WordCampus, we didn’t want it to get in the way of what we hope to achieve, so the topic was passionately discussed at a planning meeting. The entire community cast their votes for a new name and WPCampus was selected as the clear winner,&amp;#8221; Carden told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 250 people have expressed interest in WPCampus. If you’re interested in speaking, sponsoring, or attending the event, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;fill out the survey. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reality is that more and more decisions, including decisions about life and death, are being made by software,” Thomas Dullien, a well-known security researcher and reverse engineer who goes by the Twitter handle Halvar Flake, said in an email. “But for the vast majority of software you interact with, you are not allowed to examine how it functions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s great to see more of the world waking up to the importance of open source.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Freenode to Purge Inactive Nicks, Channels, and Accounts on October 2nd</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48346</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/freenode-to-purge-inactive-nicks-channels-and-accounts-on-october-2nd</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cleaning.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-16322&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cleaning.jpg?resize=1025%2C491&quot; alt=&quot;photo credit: 13Moya 十三磨牙 - cc&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ericqian/4447132325/&quot;&gt;13Moya 十三磨牙&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://freenode.net/&quot;&gt;Freenode&lt;/a&gt;, the IRC network responsible for hosting communication servers for WordPress and many other open source projects &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.freenode.net/2015/09/services-database-purge/&quot;&gt;will be performing maintenance&lt;/a&gt; on or around October 2nd. Freenode will remove expired nicks, channels, and accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a lot of people have switched to &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt; from IRC to communicate in real-time, the WordPress support channel with hundreds of users still exists on Freenode with no plans to move it to Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a registered account on Freenode and have not identified with the service in 120 days or more, you must authenticate your account before October 2nd. You can do this by connecting to Freenode and using the &lt;em&gt;/msg nickserv identify&lt;/em&gt; command, then enter your password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve forgotten your password, use the &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;verbatim-b&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://freenode.net/faq.shtml&quot;&gt;/msg nickserv sendpass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; command to recover lost passwords. Alternatively, use the &lt;em&gt;/msg nickserv help sendpass&lt;/em&gt; command to receive help recovering your password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s especially important for users who have registered channels on Freenode to authenticate or else the username and channels associated with it will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Donncha: WP Super Cache 1.4.5</title>
	<guid>http://z9.io/?p=89499667</guid>
	<link>http://z9.io/2015/09/25/wp-super-cache-1-4-5/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/&quot;&gt;WP Super Cache&lt;/a&gt; is a fast caching plugin for WordPress. It will help your site run faster and serve more traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a security and bugfix release.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some servers display a directory index when no index.html is found in a directory. That may reveal the filenames of cache files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There were issues in the settings page that might allow an attacker to browse or delete files named index.html.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; PHP Object Injection could occur if an attacker managed to inject malicious code into the legacy cache meta files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you upgrade, your “legacy cache” files for logged in users will be deleted. This may have an impact on your site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your site is slow at generating new pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have many known users (logged in users or people who comment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your site will suddenly have to generate new cache files for all visiting known users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on caching like this is not recommended for these types of users as it’s very inefficient. Each user has a separate cache file that must be checked whenever the plugin does administration work like cleaning up stale cache files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If most of your traffic is anonymous users who don’t comment you don’t need to worry about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Directory Listings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a server is configured to show directory listings it will show files and directories in the cache directory to visitors who access those directories directly through their browser. This might reveal private posts, and in the case where legacy caching is enabled for known users the login cookie was stored in &amp;#8220;.meta&amp;#8221; files that could be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-11-at-14.40.00.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-11-at-14.40.00.png?resize=660%2C275&quot; alt=&quot;2013&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-89499673&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files named &amp;#8220;index.html&amp;#8221; were added to the main cache directories to stop remote users viewing the contents of the cache directories. Unfortunately it&amp;#8217;s not possible to add empty index.html files to the supercache directories because those files could be served by accident to legitimate visitors of the site. However, the plugin will also add a directive that disables directory listings to the file cache/.htaccess. You can now also change the location of the cache directory on the Advanced Settings page of the plugin. If you can&amp;#8217;t disable directory indexing on your server and you have private posts you should change this location and use PHP mode to serve cache files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/cache-location.png?resize=660%2C314&quot; alt=&quot;cache-location&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-89499679&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a directory index is found in the cache directory it will show a warning like this to administrators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-12.27.29.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-12.27.29.png?resize=660%2C231&quot; alt=&quot;index.html warnings&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-89499671&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking the logout link will log everyone out, except the user who clicks it, but it guarantees that the login cookies are updated, just in case someone has copied the cookie from an old meta file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Directory Traversal and File Deletion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User input in the settings page wasn&amp;#8217;t properly sanitised. The code that sanitised directory paths when deleting cache files wasn&amp;#8217;t secure and might allow an attacker to view or delete files named index.html. Deletes are protected by a nonce, limiting the useful lifetime of the URL however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PHP Object Injection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin used serialize and unserialize &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-object-injection?replies=2&quot;&gt;to store data&lt;/a&gt; in &amp;#8220;legacy cache&amp;#8221; meta files. This might be used to perform a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection&quot;&gt;PHP object injection&lt;/a&gt; attack. Serialised data is now stored as JSON data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of legacy cached files has changed. The files in the meta directory no longer have a .meta extension. They are .php files now and each file has a &amp;#8220;die()&amp;#8221; command to stop anyone loading them.&lt;br /&gt;
The data stored in those files is now stored as JSON serialised data. The login cookie is an MD5 hash now as well.&lt;br /&gt;
When you upgrade the plugin your existing legacy cache files will be deleted and regenerated as visitors use your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from those security fixes there have been a number of enhancements and bugfixes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Disabling the plugin no longer deletes the configuration file. Uninstalling will do that however.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Enhancement: Only preload public post types. Props webaware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It&amp;#8217;s now possible to deactivate the plugin without visiting the settings page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Fixed the cache rebuild system. Rebuild files were deleted immediately but now survive up to 10 seconds longer than the request that generate them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Minor optimisations: prune_super_cache() exits immediately if the file doesn&amp;#8217;t exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The output of wp_cache_get_cookies_values() is now cached per visit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Added PHP pid to the debug log to aid debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Various small bug fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Fixed reset of expiry time and GC settings when updating advanced settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Removed CacheMeta class to avoid APC errors. It&amp;#8217;s not used any more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Fixed reset of advanced settings when using &amp;#8220;easy&amp;#8221; settings page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release wouldn&amp;#8217;t be possible without the help of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kraft.im/&quot;&gt;Brandon Kraft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dane&quot;&gt;Dane Odekirk&lt;/a&gt;, Ben Bidner, Jouko Pynnönen and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrutinizer-ci.com/&quot;&gt;Scrutinizer&lt;/a&gt;.

	<title>WPTavern: Lessons I Learned Moderating Comments in WordPress</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48340</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/lessons-i-learned-moderating-comments-in-wordpress</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the past 4-5 weeks, I&amp;#8217;ve moderated every comment submitted to WP Tavern. Not only was it an experiment to see what would happen but a new way for me to use WordPress. The experiment introduced me to several drawbacks in WordPress&amp;#8217; comment moderation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lack of Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments that are pending moderation in the WordPress backend that are in response to another comment are hard to moderate. Take the following screenshot for example. This comment is in response to a comment submitted by Norcross. Unless I open Norcross&amp;#8217; comment in a new browser tab or window, I have no idea what the context of the conversation is. Pending notifications in the WordPress mobile app also don&amp;#8217;t show text from the parent comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48150&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png?resize=851%2C161&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area
&lt;p&gt;I propose that WordPress core adds the text from parent comments to replies in the backend so I know what people are responding too. This also helps when replying to comments from the backend as I&amp;#8217;ll know the context of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lack of Notifications That a Comment in Moderation is Approved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress does not send an email notification when a comment is approved from moderation. However, there are a lot of people &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717&quot;&gt;working to add&lt;/a&gt; this feature to WordPress 4.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Whitelisting System for Anonymous Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest drawback to comment moderation is that not every comment needs to be moderated. A whitelisting system can lessen the burden of having to moderate each comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress provides the ability to blacklist comments. You can also configure a set of parameters to determine when a comment goes into the moderation queue such as, number of links, content within the comment, and if the comment author has a previously approved comment. None of these configurations are useful if WordPress is configured to send every comment to moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WP Tavern does not have open registration and allows comments from anonymous people. This makes whitelisting difficult since the IP address, name, URL, and email address of a commenter can easily change or be imitated. The whitelisting component of WordPress becomes more useful if you can tie it to a registered user account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m unsure if WordPress can improve this area of the moderation system or if it&amp;#8217;s an assumed risk administrators take when accepting anonymous comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Major Time Suck&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderating every comment is a pain and sucks up time that can be spent doing something else. During my vacation last week, I continued to moderate comments from the WordPress mobile app because if I didn&amp;#8217;t, the conversation stopped. I&amp;#8217;ve concluded that by accepting anonymous comments, there needs to be a way for the audience to help moderate instead of doing it on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a future post, I&amp;#8217;m going to list a few WordPress plugins I&amp;#8217;ve discovered that takes the commenting system to the next level. Many of the plugins solve one or most of the problems listed above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WP Super Cache 1.4.5 Patches XSS Vulnerability</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48336</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-super-cache-1-4-5-patches-xss-vulnerability</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you use &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/&quot;&gt;WP Super Cache&lt;/a&gt;, you should immediately update to version 1.4.5 as it &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/changelog/&quot;&gt;patches a XSS vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; in the settings page. This version also prevents PHP object injections. In addition to security patches, 1.4.5 contains a number of bug fixes. Make sure to update your sites as soon as possible to patch the vulnerability. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://z9.io/2015/09/25/wp-super-cache-1-4-5/&quot;&gt;find more details&lt;/a&gt; on this release on Donncha Ó Caoimh&amp;#8217;s website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: All about the WordPress REST API and its current state — Draft podcast</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14463</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/the-wordpress-rest-api-draft-podcast/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Post Status Draft podcast, which you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008&quot;&gt;on iTunes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss&quot;&gt;via RSS&lt;/a&gt; for your favorite podcatcher. Brian and his co-host, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle&quot;&gt;Joe Hoyle&lt;/a&gt;, a co-founder and the CTO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hmn.md/&quot;&gt;Human Made&lt;/a&gt;, discuss some of today’s hottest, current WordPress news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, Joe and Brian go into depth discussing all aspects of the WordPress REST API, and the state of the API today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the recent merge proposal, there is a good chance it will be included in WordPress core via a two stage process in the WordPress 4.4 and 4.5 releases. The first release would be the core infrastructure and the second release would include the endpoints. This is our longest podcast, but we go in depth on one of WordPress&amp;#8217;s most anticipated features in years.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Akismet: Akismet WordPress Plugin 3.1.4</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1873</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/09/24/akismet-3-1-4-wordpress/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Version 3.1.4 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the Akismet plugin for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; is now available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update clarifies the error messages that Akismet uses so that they&amp;#8217;re easier to understand, and it enables link previews in the admin for all links in a comment &amp;#8212; not just the author&amp;#8217;s website link. A fix is also included for a bug that could have caused comment moderation emails to be sent for some comments that were caught as spam.  For a full list of the changes in this release, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/akismet/trunk&quot;&gt;revision log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions. If you need to download the plugin zip file directly, links to all versions are available in &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the WordPress plugins directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1873&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WP Comment Humility Relocates the Comments Top-level Menu Item to the Posts Menu</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48313</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-comment-humility-relocates-the-comments-top-level-menu-item-to-the-posts-menu</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-billie-named-after-jazz-singer-billie-holiday-is-available-for-download&quot;&gt;features in WordPress 4.3&lt;/a&gt; is that comments on pages are disabled by default. If you only enable comments for posts, you may be interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;WP Comment Humility&lt;/a&gt;, a new plugin created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;John James Jacoby&lt;/a&gt; that moves the top-level Comments menu item to the Posts menu. The following screenshot better illustrates what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48314&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png?resize=429%2C378&quot; alt=&quot;Comment Humility in Action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Comment Humility in Action
&lt;p&gt;If a site enables comments for posts only, this location for the menu item makes sense. What if you&amp;#8217;re using Custom Post Types? According the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/faq/&quot;&gt;plugin&amp;#8217;s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, the user experience might be weird, &amp;#8220;If you have a post type other than &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; that supports comments, it may make more sense to not use this plugin,&amp;#8221; Jacoby said. He suggests giving it a try and if the user experience doesn&amp;#8217;t feel right, to disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/stuttter/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;located on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; where you can also submit Pull Requests. WP Comment Humility works out-of-the-box without any configuration options on WordPress 4.3 and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; in the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Highlights From Matt Mullenweg’s Q&amp;A Session on Product Hunt</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48303</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/highlights-from-matt-mullenwegs-qa-session-on-product-hunt</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;On September 22nd, Matt Mullenweg participated in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;question and answer session&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. Product Hunt is a site &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;that lets users share and discover new products. In the session, Mullenweg answers questions like what advice he&amp;#8217;d give to his 20 and 25-year-old self and how he combats burn out. Here are a few highlights from the session.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nikhil V&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Hello Matt, with the upcoming release of the WP REST API in WordPress core, what do you hope to most see built with its capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m hugely excited about the REST API! Once the infrastructure is in, I think we&amp;#8217;ll see really widespread adoption from plugins that right now are creating their endpoints in very ad-hoc ways. Once we iterate a bit more on the core content endpoints and authentication I think we&amp;#8217;ll see a lot more specialized interfaces built on WP as like a content kernel, an engine powering a wide array of applications and interfaces you&amp;#8217;d never imagine having WordPress behind them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erik Torenberg &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;If you could go back in time and give advice for your, say, 20-year-old self, what would you tell yourself? How about 25?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; To my 20-year-old self I would say to be okay with things building up over time. Something I didn&amp;#8217;t appreciate until recently is that there any many productive decades ahead with which to build the things that I feel need to exist in the world. One of the best things I did then was avoid any press or capitalization on my age (to the extent I could) because youth is an ephemeral asset and just a novelty in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my 25-year-old self I would tell him to slow down and think about health more, I burned the candle at both ends that year. I would also say to not get as caught up in mailing list and IRC arguments and discussions, just focus on building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sydney Liu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In the early days of WordPress, what was the 20% that got you the 80% of the results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; There&amp;#8217;s no simple answer there, if I had to pick one thing it would be &lt;em&gt;luck&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Kristof Bernaert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; How do you see WP about 5 years, or how do you want it to see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In 5 years I think that WP will be infinitely easier to use for both power-users, developers, and newbies. You will be able to have a full experience of core, plugins, themes, docs, and support in several dozen languages that will be as large or larger than English. There will be over a million people making their living on top of the platform. Most people will be creating from touch devices, and their content will mostly not come from keyboards (virtual or physical) as an input device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Tys Bradford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;&amp;#8211; Your accomplishments with WordPress have literally changed the face of the internet and enabled people without programming skills to make beautiful and functional websites. Do you think this could be replicated ever with mobile applications (iOS/Android)? I have seen a few companies try, but none have come close to delivering in the way WordPress is able to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Thank you! The ecosystems and app stores for iOS and Android right now are too locked down, and the discoverability and overhead of apps is too distorted, for an approach like WordPress&amp;#8217; to work for mobile applications. The environment for the foreseeable future there is going to favor more centralized apps, my only hope is that at least a few get really successful (including ours) that aren&amp;#8217;t advertising-driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Question Was Not Answered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my question was not answered. However, I&amp;#8217;m going to ask it in this post with the hope that he&amp;#8217;ll answer it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve spent a lot of time, money, and energy trying to create a great mobile experience in WordPress via dedicated apps. As more of the WordPress backend becomes responsive, how will this affect (if any) the priority level of developing the mobile apps versus putting that time and effort into a 100% responsive WordPress backend?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullenweg answers a lot more questions than what&amp;#8217;s listed above but those are the ones that stand out to me. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;read the entire session&lt;/a&gt; on the Product Hunt site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress REST API Is One Major Step Closer to Being Merged Into Core</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48284</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-rest-api-is-one-major-step-closer-to-being-merged-into-core</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After more than three years of development, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://v2.wp-api.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress REST API&lt;/a&gt; is one major step closer to getting merged into core. Ryan McCue, a lead contributor to the project, published the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;official proposal&lt;/a&gt; to merge the API into WordPress. The proposal explains what the REST API is, why it&amp;#8217;s needed, an integration plan, and what happens after the merge. The plan is to integrate the API in two stages, infrastructure and endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Part Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure is the code responsible for routing requests and handling the meta layer of the API, including JSON serialization/deserialization, linking, embedding, and REST best practices. Merging the infrastructure first allows developers to start building upon it and to migrate from existing custom code. The plan is to merge the infrastructure portion of the API in WordPress 4.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endpoints are considered the more complex of the two as they’re responsible for mapping data from the external JSON format to the internal data structures and vice versa. In other words, endpoints are the bridges of communication between WordPress and external applications. To provide more time for core committers to review the code, endpoints will be merged in WordPress 4.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of the API &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API&quot;&gt;takes place on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; but core WordPress development takes place on Subversion and Trac. When the API is merged into core, it will no longer be developed as a separate project. McCue proposes that the best of GitHub and Trac be integrated so developers comfortable with GitHub can continue to contribute to the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the team’s experience with GitHub as well as Trac, we can bring the best of both worlds by helping integrate the two. This would also improve contributions to WordPress as a whole, and benefit the whole community. This will be especially important as we encourage more contributions from the wider community (client authors, for example). We think we can make good progress here, and we’d love to try to help improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress&quot;&gt;GitHub repository for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;s synced to its Subversion counterpart, it does not accept pull requests. If integrating GitHub and Trac proves to be successful, it could open the door for WordPress to accept pull requests or contributions through GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan to merge the API into core is not finalized and the team needs your &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;comments, questions, and opinions&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage you to read the full proposal and the comments as McCue answers additional questions related to the merge. How happy are you to see this merge proposal?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The Impacts HeroPress Is Having on WordPress Communities in India</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48286</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-impacts-heropress-is-having-on-wordpress-communities-in-india</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Topher DeRosia, who recently attended&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia&quot;&gt; WordCamp Pune&lt;/a&gt;, India, &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/subtle-impacts/&quot;&gt;published a post on the HeroPress blog&lt;/a&gt; that describes the subtle impacts the project is having on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saurabh Shukla, lead organizer for WordCamp Pune, says the site inspired not only their speaker selection but their presentations as well, &amp;#8220;We wanted people to derive at least a level of inspiration from the speakers and decided that stories make more sense than presentations,&amp;#8221; Shukla said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of inspiring presentations at WordCamp Pune include, a workshop where people could experience accessibility issues for themselves, WordPress for activism, and building education products for South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Presentation in a Classroom at WordCamp Pune
&lt;p&gt;According to DeRosia, many Indians feel like their WordPress communities are not getting the respect they deserve. DeRosia believes the amount of excitement expressed by Indians for HeroPress is because their work is noticed and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;That&lt;/em&gt; is why India is excited about HeroPress. They’re getting respect. Not just from me, but from thousands of readers around the world,&amp;#8221; DeRosia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although DeRosia says he&amp;#8217;d be content with the impacts the site has had if HeroPress ended today, I would be sad to see it go  because it&amp;#8217;s a great addition to the WordPress community. Thankfully, DeRosia says people are requesting more essays, exchanges of knowledge, shared wisdom, shared respect, and more of the HeroPress spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an essay published on HeroPress or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;project&amp;#8217;s mission&lt;/a&gt; has inspired you in any way, please let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Interview, and Complementing Slack</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45326</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/09/complementing-slack/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.me/tonyconrad&quot;&gt;Tony Conrad&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strictlyvc.com/&quot;&gt;StrictlyVC&lt;/a&gt; event in San Francisco last week, following a dizzyingly talented line-up of &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/chamath-palihapitaya-on-insane-burn-rates-ipos-and-raising-a-new-real-estate-fund/&quot;&gt;Chamath Palihapitiya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dfj.com/content/steve-jurvetson&quot;&gt;Steve Jurvetson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/18/move-over-slack-automattic-mulls-commercializing-its-own-internal-messaging-product/&quot;&gt;Techcrunch has a good write-up with a number of the relevant quotes from the event&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing I&amp;#8217;d like to respond to, because it wasn&amp;#8217;t a direct quote, is the headline &amp;#8220;Move Over Slack? Automattic Mulls Commercializing Its Own Internal Messaging Product.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem is the headline missed the obvious alliteration of &amp;#8220;Mullenweg Mulls,&amp;#8221; &lt;img src=&quot;http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f600.png&quot; alt=&quot;😀&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;but more importantly&amp;#8230; &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; has become a really key tool for both Automattic &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;and WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt; and anything we do with the evolution of &lt;a href=&quot;http://p2theme.com/&quot;&gt;P2&lt;/a&gt; (some of which we already have running internally) will be complementary to Slack, not competitive with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jeff Yablon and the WordPress Foundation Settle Out of Court</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48267</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jeff-yablon-and-the-wordpress-foundation-settle-out-of-court</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation sued Jeff Yablon&lt;/a&gt; for trademark infringement. The Foundation wanted Yablon to stop using its trademarks, dismiss the opposition proceeding, pay the foundation for any profits related to use of the WordPress trademarks, pay up to $100,000 per infringing domain name, transfer the domains and pay other fees and damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline of Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 22nd, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=7&quot;&gt;Yablon filed a request&lt;/a&gt; for default judgement. On June 29th, the Foundation responded to Yablon by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=8&quot;&gt;asking the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board&lt;/a&gt; to deny Yablon&amp;#8217;s request for default judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 9th, David Mermelstein, Administrative Trademark Judge, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=9&quot;&gt;filed a response&lt;/a&gt; that not only denied Yablon&amp;#8217;s motion for default judgment, but also suspended proceedings until the civil case was complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With proceedings suspended, Yablon could no longer file motions or requests with the TTAB. The only option left was to proceed through court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Settlement Between Yablon and The Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 21st, Yablon and the WordPress Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudup.com/cLmq3DWS6MZ&quot;&gt;settled out of court&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48277&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png?resize=839%2C621&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of Settlement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sample of Settlement
&lt;h3&gt;Yablon&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the settlement, by no later than October 15th, Yablon agrees to cease any and all use of the WordPress name, logos, trademarks, and any other name or mark confusingly similar to the term WordPress or its logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also has to cease any and all use of the WordPress Marks, standing alone or in combination with other words or designs, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use in any company name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta-tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personalized URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyword Advertising on Yablon&amp;#8217;s websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media handles or account names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indoor outdoor store signage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letterhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stationary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon must also comply with the terms of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/&quot;&gt;WordPress trademark and domain name policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No later than five days after the effective date (Oct 15th), Yablon has to transfer all of the domains he owns that incorporate the WordPress Mark to the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Yablon acknowledges that the Foundation owns and has the exclusive rights in and to the WordPress marks in connection with the goods and services identified in each of WordPress&amp;#8217; registrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon can no longer do anything inconsistent with the Foundation&amp;#8217;s ownership of its WordPress Marks and registrations thereof, including but not limited to, contesting the Foundation&amp;#8217;s title to or the validity of the WordPress marks or the trademark registrations thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WordPress Foundation&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Yablon transfers the domains to the Foundation and does not breach the terms of the agreement, the Foundation will redirect the domains to a domain of Yablon&amp;#8217;s choosing for 6 months from the effective date or April 1, 2016, whichever comes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 10 days of the domains being transferred, the Foundation will file a stipulated request to withdrawal its U.S. Opposition Proceeding No. 91221895 without prejudice and Case 3:15-cv02745 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, without prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as Yablon does not breach the agreement, the Foundation agrees not to sue for violating its trademarks prior to the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation will not object to Yablon&amp;#8217;s use of the WordPress Marks as part of any subdomains or subdirectories associated with any second level domain name registered to and controlled exclusively by Yablon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples include but are not limited to, wordpress.answerguy.com or answerguy.com/wordpress in connection with services that involve use of the WordPress platform, support the WordPress brand services, and that do not otherwise violate the rights of the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parties agree to bear their own attorney&amp;#8217;s fees and costs, if any were incurred through the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;spoke to Yablon&lt;/a&gt; on the phone in June shortly after the lawsuit was filed, he sounded like he knew what he was getting into and the complexities involved with U.S. Trademarks. Yablon strongly believed he had enough evidence to pursue the matter and to see it through the court system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing the court case all the way through, he chose to give up which in the court system, is not the same thing as losing, as losing or winning sets a precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Yablon didn&amp;#8217;t lose the case, the WordPress Foundation didn&amp;#8217;t win either. It&amp;#8217;s a reminder that the Foundation will aggressively defend its trademarks in the court system if other means prove unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think Yablon’s mission to defend his use of WordPress in a top-level domain name and potentially open the door for others to do the same, was in the best interest of the WordPress community as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: Gravity Flow makes custom form administrative workflows simple</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14337</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/gravity-flow-makes-custom-form-administrative-workflows-simple/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;Gravity Flow&lt;/a&gt; is one of the coolest new plugins I&amp;#8217;ve seen in quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoices, purchase orders, job applications, and employee vacation requests are just a few potential applications for Gravity Flow, which makes form-centric approval, user input, and notification processes simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With Gravity Flow, you use the power of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; to design your forms, and you use Gravity Flow to design your process using easy to use drag-and-drop tools,&amp;#8221; the video states. The flows created in Gravity Flow can be customized to include all sorts of user-defined paths to request stakeholder feedback, get administrative approval, or fire off a notification that a certain step in the flow has been accomplished. It can even be integrated with other notification systems like Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that common to see a WordPress plugin (especially an add-on plugin) that simultaneously targets a niche and serves it so extensively. Gravity Flow is built to extend the powerful Gravity Forms product, and it really takes it an extra mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of potential for Gravity Flow for intranets and other corporate environments with lots of stakeholders and traditionally clunky, email based workflows for approval of common tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trying Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took Gravity Flow for a spin, because there is a handy demo site capability built in. For a plugin this complex, being able to test drive it is a really great feature. Most workflow tasks can take place either in the admin or on the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating workflows feels a lot like adding regular notifications to Gravity Forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14340&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-workflow-752x579.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workflows have many configuration and sending options. And each step can be sorted and arranged to follow a series of steps, and can even allow for delays (like for a scholarship review period, in my example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s the view for an administrator, but someone who is responsible for providing feedback or approval has a front-end view to directly interact with the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14339&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-review-update-workflow-752x872.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-review-update-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;872&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And administrators can see reports of activity for various workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14338&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-reports-752x552.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-reports&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;552&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty simple overview of the plugin, and I&amp;#8217;d recommend you &lt;a href=&quot;http://demo.gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the demo&lt;/a&gt;, or his full &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.gravityflow.io/category/34-walkthroughs&quot;&gt;walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; examples. but this at least highlights some of the plugin&amp;#8217;s power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Development of Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting things about Gravity Flow is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Henty&lt;/a&gt; made it. Steven actually works at Rocketgenius, the company behind Gravity Forms, and he is a developer of the main Gravity Forms product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to Steven about why this isn&amp;#8217;t a Gravity Forms official add-on, and what it&amp;#8217;s like working on a side project for your own company&amp;#8217;s product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocketgenius has a lot of plans and loads of really exciting stuff in the pipeline so it was a question of priorities &amp;#8211; Rocketgenius can’t possibly do absolutely everything at the same time. For me it’s a project that’s niche enough to be an interesting and profitable side project and yet not too time-consuming so I can continue to focus 100% on my day job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterated how important it is to him that he had his team behind him for this project. And Carl Hancock &amp;#8212; co-founder of Rocketgenius &amp;#8212; is excited about Steven&amp;#8217;s product as well, saying &amp;#8220;The product is awesome. It&amp;#8217;s definitely more complex [and] business oriented, but that&amp;#8217;s a good thing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl also shared that Steve has a background that lends itself to thinking about complex problems to solve, working on, &amp;#8220;more enterprise stuff pre-WordPress, on a wide variety of platforms and programming languages.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve did a great job with Gravity Flow, and I&amp;#8217;m happy to see it out there.  On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/gravity-flow/&quot;&gt;his personal blog&lt;/a&gt;, he highlights use cases for the product, which are real world examples based on how his first 100 beta testers are using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gravity ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Rocketgenius employees have Gravity Forms focused side projects, which I think is really cool. Another favorite of mine is David Smith&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://gravitywiz.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Wiz&lt;/a&gt;, that adds functionality snippets, or &amp;#8220;perks&amp;#8221;, to Gravity Forms. The third-party ecosystem is doing well too; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityplus.pro/&quot;&gt;Gravity Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityview.co/&quot;&gt;Gravity View&lt;/a&gt; are two healthy Gravity Forms focused businesses that come to mind, and I&amp;#8217;m sure there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main plugin continues to dominate the WordPress forms space. Though it is commercial only, it powers hundreds of thousands of websites, and has dozens of official &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/&quot;&gt;add-ons&lt;/a&gt;. Carl has told me many times he doesn&amp;#8217;t even view most other WordPress forms plugins as competition (though newer entrants like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ninjaforms.com/&quot;&gt;Ninja Forms&lt;/a&gt; are doing quite well for themselves), as Gravity Forms aims to take marketshare away from complex hosted solutions like Wufoo, rather than gobble up the much larger but less demanding market that just wants simple contact forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up with Gravity Flow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the website&lt;/a&gt;. And the project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stevehenty/gravityflow&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt; as well, as Steve is billing for support and automatic upgrades, which starts at €87 (around $100) per year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems like the longest days are those in between an Apple announcement and when the products are actually available. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to iOS 9, WatchOS 2, 6s+, Apple TV&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Recap of WordCamp Pune, India, by Topher DeRosia</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48212</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48213&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; href=&quot;http://topher1kenobe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Topher DeRosia&lt;/a&gt;. Topher has contributed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe#content-plugins&quot;&gt;number of plugins&lt;/a&gt;, spoken at many WordCamps, and is the lead of documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://easydigitaldownloads.com/&quot;&gt;Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/a&gt; He also operates &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/&quot;&gt;HeroPress.com&lt;/a&gt; on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last July, the lead organizer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pune.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Pune, India &lt;/a&gt;asked if I would come and speak about HeroPress. This post isn&amp;#8217;t going to be about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;HeroPress&lt;/a&gt; nor about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/category/wordcamp/pune/&quot;&gt;my adventures on the trip&lt;/a&gt;. No, this post is going to be about a WordCamp in a relatively large city in India, how it compares to American WordCamps, and some things that were experimented with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Similarities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, WordCamp Pune is exactly like every other WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve been to. The night before the event, there was a speaker dinner with excellent food and wonderful company. Registration was chaotic because WiFi was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone was happy and excited to be there, and it was very loud because everyone wanted to be part of a conversation. It had all the elements I love about WordCamps; handshakes between new friends, hugs between old friends, and huge transfers of information between everyone, it was fantastic. Aside from WordCamp Miami, it&amp;#8217;s also the largest WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended with 500 tickets sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was well-organized, by which I mean things were well planned for, and handled well when they didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Sessions were held in university class rooms. I think they were a little small for the number of attendees, but it didn&amp;#8217;t detract from the experience. Here&amp;#8217;s an example of a room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s Ramya Pandyan talking about being a better blogger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended where the sessions were in a variety of languages. I would expect this in a place like WordCamp EU, but to have it be a variety of &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; languages was fascinating to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unofficial time zone of India is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/04/28/india-journal-understanding-ist-indian-stretchable-time/&quot;&gt;Indian Stretchable Time&lt;/a&gt;. On the first day of WordCamp, Saurabh worked hard to keep things on schedule. We started 30 minutes late, but on Foundation Day, things got started an hour late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was full of people sitting and waiting patiently, but starting on time was &lt;strong&gt;not expected&lt;/strong&gt;. In the US, I would have expected a lot more cranky people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things were heavily guarded. The main venue was quite open, but to get into Foundation Day, I had to let these guys check me with a magnetic wand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48219&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png?resize=904%2C510&quot; alt=&quot;Indian Policemen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then 20 feet away sign in at a guard house, and then 30 feet beyond that show my ID inside the front door of the venue. This kind of thing also happened at restaurants and every time I went into my hotel. No-one was ever aggressive or suspicious, it&amp;#8217;s just something that happened and everyone took it in stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Word Lounge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48220&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png?resize=298%2C462&quot; alt=&quot;Word Lounge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There was a room set aside to be an all day open session for writers. There&amp;#8217;s a local group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlphabetSambar&quot;&gt;Alphabet Sambar&lt;/a&gt; (Sambar is a soup) that has a regular meetup to help each other with writing. They made sure to welcome attendees and keep a good discussion going all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this idea of unconference rooms based on topic. Some people thrive on the group communication that can come from that format, and I&amp;#8217;d love to see other topical open forums at other WordCamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The After Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of quiet after parties, so I can talk to people. I can also appreciate people wanting a pretty intense party atmosphere. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/crccpune&quot;&gt;Classic Rock Coffee Co.&lt;/a&gt; offered both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had three large areas, the largest being almost 6000 sq. ft., one about 800 sq. ft., and an ampitheater with seating for about 100 where they had live classic rock bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was a closed in area with seating for about 40 people that felt more like a cafe or restaurant. The larger open areas had a full bar and restaurant. Except for the cafe, the whole place had a fabric roof which is less sturdy than canvas. It had an outdoors feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at a table of about 15 people and had no trouble communicating with any of them. I was probably 130 feet from the music and it was well contained. I was able to communicate without noise being an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of people sat at tables, in the cafe, in the ampitheater; wherever they were most comfortable. It was probably my favorite after-party venue of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia#gallery-48212-1-slideshow&quot;&gt;Click to view slideshow.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bits and Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult thing for me was trying to discern people through their accents. Just about everyone had a solid handle on English, but there&amp;#8217;s a mental fatigue that comes from parsing the words through an accent. The longer you do it, the harder it gets, especially with sleep deprivation. I tried not to be rude, and people were patient with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a photo area with some crazy hats and people seemed to have a really good time with it. I can see it working at other WordCamps as well. The ladies from Hummingbird got one of me in a crazy hat, but I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48226&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png?resize=1025%2C578&quot; alt=&quot;Crazy Hat Picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was prepared on-site in realtime and it worked. It was mostly sandwiches, and the food prep people took a request, made the sandwich, and handed it to the person in moments. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have expected it to work that smoothly, but it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit and bottled water were available just about all the time, which was nice since it was pretty hot that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the food and language, this WordCamp didn&amp;#8217;t feel all that foreign to me. I suspect it&amp;#8217;s because WordCamps have a solid template for sessions, scheduling, etc. I enjoyed that, it enabled me to really take part in the event without having to stand to the side wondering what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers seemed to be on the ball and did a great job sharing the responsibilities, which I think is vital with a camp this size. The people were engaged, took full advantage of the options available to them, and &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; is what made it a successful WordCamp in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever get the chance to attend a WordCamp in a culture other than your own, I highly recommend you jump at the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Look Inside the Offices of 16 People Who Work With WordPress on a Daily Basis</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48204</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-look-inside-the-offices-of-16-people-who-work-with-wordpress-on-a-daily-basis</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a remote worker environment, people have the choice to work from home or wherever it&amp;#8217;s convenient. Syed Waseem Abbas published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://torquemag.io/inside-the-workplaces-of-16-wordpress-community-mavens/&quot;&gt;guest post on Torquemag,&lt;/a&gt; that looks at the offices of 16 people who work with WordPress on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the offices are classy while others are small. Many of the people featured in the post use one or more Apple products. If you&amp;#8217;re curious as to what my setup looks like, here you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48205&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg?resize=960%2C720&quot; alt=&quot;My Home Office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My Home Office
&lt;p&gt;Most of the work I do is on a Windows 7 Professional 64bit desktop PC with two 23-inch monitors. When I work remotely, I use a fully loaded 15-inch MacBook Pro with retina display from 2013. As a devoted Windows user, I feel like I&amp;#8217;m part of a dying breed, especially within the WordPress ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For WordPress Weekly, I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000PTF0E2&quot;&gt;Samson CO1U&lt;/a&gt; USB powered condenser microphone connected to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/musical-instruments/dp/B001D7UYBO/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442008126&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Rode+Swivel+mount&quot;&gt;Rode PSA1 swivel mount&lt;/a&gt; with a boom arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predominantly work in a sitting position which is why I&amp;#8217;m in the market for a standing desk where the height can be easily adjusted. I&amp;#8217;m also looking for a new office chair where the arm rests don&amp;#8217;t disintegrate within the first year of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions, let me know in the comments. Also, if you need inspiration to create the perfect office environment, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://officetoday.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Office Today&lt;/a&gt;. Office Today features remote offices and locations from across the world used by Automattic employees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/tickets/attendees/&quot;&gt;attendees list&lt;/a&gt; so far, the event is shaping up to be a great opportunity to meet some of the best of the best in the WordPress ecosystem. Expect this list to grow as more tickets become available.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;The bbPress development team &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2015/09/2015-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;published the results&lt;/a&gt; of its 2015 survey. This year, 213 people participated which is 30 more &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2014/05/2014-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;than last year&lt;/a&gt;. After reviewing, replacing, and removing some questions from the 2014 survey, this year&amp;#8217;s survey has 25 questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of survey question types were used to gather the data including, multiple choices, check boxes, text fields, email box, and open‐ended questions. Empty forms were deleted and those marked as incomplete were reviewed individually. Submissions that had no responses on the second and third pages of the survey were excluded from the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highlights From the Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of respondents use bbPress 2.5 and above with WordPress 4.2 and above. Seventy-one percent of participants using bbPress &amp;lt;=1.x.x are also using the latest version of WordPress. This data indicates bbPress users are vigilant in keeping their sites up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of who uses bbPress, 51% of respondents use it on their own sites while 30% create sites with bbPress forums for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48182&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png?resize=485%2C249&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress 2015 Survey Users&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress 2015 Survey Who Uses bbPress
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, the top three languages used are English 74%, German 7%, and French 6.5%. Three-fourths or 75% of bbPress installations are within WordPress either in the domain root, physical directory, or physical subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining 25% are on multisite installations where more than half have activated bbPress network-wide and the rest in multiple networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One statistic I&amp;#8217;m proud of is that 29% of the respondents found out about the survey through WP Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;

A preference for Responsive, mobile-first themes is in fourth place at 39%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, Attachments (42.5%), Ajaxification of Topics and Replies (41.5%), and Moderation tools in the front end (39%) are the most requested features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48196&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png?resize=463%2C219&quot; alt=&quot;2015 Most Requested Features&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2015 Most Requested Features
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of bbPress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercime, a BuddyPress and bbPress core contributor, confirmed at the end of the survey that the bbPress project is alive and well. According to Mercime, the development team is in the middle of a large migration project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/src/humans.txt&quot;&gt;bbPress core team&lt;/a&gt; has been involved in the process of migrating the WordPress Support Forums (English and all Rosetta sites) from bbPress 1.x.x to bbPress 2.5.8 starting with one European-language forums subsite which has been already ported and being tested on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this migration has been discussed many times and often over the years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;@johnjamesjacoby&lt;/a&gt; formally started the process when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/05/15/wp-org-forums-plugins-audit/&quot;&gt;posted the results of an audit&lt;/a&gt; to show the custom functionality required for a successful migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involves multiple teams including, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;WP Support team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/&quot;&gt;WP Meta Team&lt;/a&gt;. The migration will impact more than 8 million users on WordPress.org. Any improvements made to bbPress to ease the migration process are going to be merged back into the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Confirms It Did Not Have a Security Breach</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48173</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpml-confirms-it-did-not-have-a-security-breach</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When WPML emailed new &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext&quot;&gt;passwords to customers in plaintext&lt;/a&gt;, some customers thought it was due to a security breach. Amit Kvint, compatibility team leader for WPML, confirmed the emails are not a result of a security breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/2015/09/password-update-email-from-wpml/&quot;&gt;post on the official WPML blog&lt;/a&gt;, Kvint says the emails were a preventive measure to insure accounts remain secure, &amp;#8220;The main purpose and underlying principle for this action was making sure everyone has a good new strong password, we consider this an important step in online security,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvint acknowledges the improvements in WordPress 4.3 in how passwords are handled and admits that sending passwords in plaintext was not a good idea, &amp;#8220;The best practice would be, once the password is sent, to login and reset the password to a new strong one. We will definitely revise the way this is done in the future,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog post does not go into detail in how they determined passwords to be weak. To the best of my knowledge, WPML does not have a policy in place to enforce strong passwords. While no accounts were compromised, if some of the contacted customers choose a weak password, wouldn&amp;#8217;t it defeat the purpose of resetting passwords in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jetpack 3.7 Introduces a Simpler Interface, Adds Support for Development Sites</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48161</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-7-introduces-a-simpler-interface-adds-support-for-development-sites</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/2015/09/09/jetpack-3-7-simpler-ui-support-for-development-sites-and-more/&quot;&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt; and includes a simpler user interface, support for development sites, and fixes several issues with a variety of modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new interface separates some of Jetpack&amp;#8217;s functionality into categories such as, performance and security, traffic growth, and WordPress.com tools. The most commonly used modules are listed first with a link underneath that takes users to the other 27 modules and the old settings page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48162&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png?resize=968%2C492&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack 3.7 Interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack 3.7 Interface
&lt;p&gt;Turning a module on or off is accomplished by clicking a toggle. Services you need to pay for are clearly marked with links to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest drawbacks to Jetpack is switching between a local server or staging environment. If you move your site from one URL to another, Jetpack automatically detects the change and prompts the user to confirm if the URL is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48163&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png?resize=1025%2C155&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack on a staging site&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack on a staging site
&lt;p&gt;If Jetpack thinks two URLs are separate websites, it recommends that you create a new connection to prevent a service interruption on the original domain. The prompt has links to reset the connection, confirm that the URL is part of a development environment, or submit a trouble ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48164&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png?resize=1025%2C143&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites
&lt;p&gt;The VideoPress player in Jetpack 3.7 works on mobile devices thanks to its responsive redesign. Having VideoPress enabled allows you to easily embed VideoPress powered videos to your site by copying and pasting the video&amp;#8217;s URL into the visual editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other changes included in 3.7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to enable per-post opt-out for Subscriptions by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/support/subscriptions/#filters&quot;&gt;adding a filter&lt;/a&gt; to a functionality plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new Widget Visibility rule that allows you to show or hide widgets based on a page’s parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing buttons now display on bbPress forum posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; from the WordPress plugin directory. To view a list of all the changes in this release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/changelog/&quot;&gt;check out the changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Conceptual WordPress Plugin by Stephen Cronin That Makes Comment Moderation Easier</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48149</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-conceptual-wordpress-plugin-by-stephen-cronin-that-makes-comment-moderation-easier</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Moderating replies to comments in the backend of WordPress is tough. For example, WordPress 4.3 displays the reply and who it&amp;#8217;s in response too, but doesn&amp;#8217;t show the text of the parent comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t see the parent comment unless you open the author link in a new browser tab. This is not an optimal user experience and makes it more difficult to determine if the reply is from a spammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48150&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png?resize=851%2C161&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;Show Parent Comment&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Cronin, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/&quot;&gt;Scratch99 Design&lt;/a&gt;, is a potential solution to the problem. Simply activate and browse to the comment section of the WordPress backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show Parent Comment displays the text of the parent comment inside the reply. This helps moderators keep track of the conversation and helps to identify copy/paste spammers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48151&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png?resize=847%2C223&quot; alt=&quot;Show Parent Comment Plugin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easy Way to See The Parent Comment
&lt;p&gt;While the plugin works as advertised and shows the parent comment text, the interface needs to be improved. I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of the background color and some of the comment information is repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea is to replace the &lt;strong&gt;In Reply to Author&lt;/strong&gt; text to say, &lt;strong&gt;In Response To&lt;/strong&gt;. The show more or less button is a good idea but I think the text size needs to be increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Show Parent Comment is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;plugin directory for free&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s a proof of concept and is not officially supported by Cronin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept needs work but I think something similar needs to be added to WordPress core. As it stands, moderating comment replies is not a great experience and I think Cronin&amp;#8217;s plugin is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Emails Passwords to Affected Customers in Plaintext</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48123</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-31477&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ClearTextPasswordFeaturedImage.png?resize=637%2C200&quot; alt=&quot;Clear Text Password&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/thegloaming/1402099967/&quot;&gt;thegloaming&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;Customers who purchased &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/&quot;&gt;WPML&lt;/a&gt;, a multilingual plugin for WordPress, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-699832&quot;&gt;are receiving&lt;/a&gt; a suspicious email that looks similar to a phishing attempt. Matt Radford, a customer of WPML, kindly sent the Tavern a copy of the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Matt&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure that your WPML account remains secure. For this, we are updating all client accounts with auto-generated strong passwords. A strong password helps prevent unauthorized use of your WPML account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our system will start the password update shortly. We will send you another email with your new password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WPML team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radford received a follow-up email that includes his new password in plaintext. WPML explains why the passwords were sent in plaintext, &amp;#8220;We detected weak passwords in our system and following this we are enforcing, on a one-time procedure, strong passwords to all our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As for sending them in plaintext, if you consider it not to be safe, please update your password in order to keep it secure,&amp;#8221; WPML said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When questioned if passwords are stored in plaintext within the database, WPML replied, &amp;#8220;As for storing passwords in our database we are not storing it in plaintext, we are using standard WordPress. Yes they&amp;#8217;re salted and hashed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise VanDeCruze, a WPML support forum moderator, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-700143&quot;&gt;the email was generated automatically&lt;/a&gt; from their systems. She confirms that sending passwords in plaintext is not a best practice and urges users to login to their accounts and generate a new password using the reset password link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This email was automatically generated by our system and sent to clients with passwords that were deemed too simple. However, sending new passwords in plain text via email without requiring user action is not best practice. I urge you to change your WPML account password. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were right to be cautious of this sudden email. Although it was not a phishing attempt, it was not the best way to ensure a safe password. In the future we will be mindful of adhering to strict security standards. Please let me know if you have any further questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WPML has not published any information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/blog/&quot;&gt;its blog&lt;/a&gt; that explains the situation and has yet to respond to our requests for comment. If you&amp;#8217;re a WPML customer and receive an email with a new password, you should immediately login and generate a new password using the site&amp;#8217;s reset password link and follow the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emailing passwords in plaintext is a terrible security practice. One of the key improvements in WordPress 4.3 is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/&quot;&gt;WordPress no longer emails passwords&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it sends password reset links that expire after 24 hours. In hindsight, WPML should have generated and sent password reset emails to affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Help Me Add Comment Approval Notifications to WordPress</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48059</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy&quot;&gt;enabling comment moderation&lt;/a&gt; on the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;ve discovered that WordPress does not notify commenters when their comments are approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;m using the &lt;a title=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot;&gt;Comment Approved&lt;/a&gt; plugin by &lt;a title=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot; href=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot;&gt;Niels van Renselaar&lt;/a&gt;. It allows me to create a custom notification message that is sent when a comment is approved. Unfortunately, I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s working. Please let me know if you&amp;#8217;ve received any comment approval emails from the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe this feature should be in core. I&amp;#8217;ve started the process by creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717&quot;&gt;feature request ticket&lt;/a&gt; on WordPress trac. Let&amp;#8217;s discuss the pros and cons or why you think it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be in core. Please give me your feedback in the comments or within the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: How Chris Klosowski’s Lifestyle Changed by Writing One WordPress Plugin</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48051</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/how-chris-klosowskis-lifestyle-changed-by-writing-one-wordpress-plugin</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Klosowski, co-lead developer of Easy Digital Downloads, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kungfugrep.com/2015/09/how-writing-one-plugin-changed-my-lifestyle/&quot;&gt;explains how writing one plugin&lt;/a&gt; changed his lifestyle. He left his corporate job to be a full-time distributed worker and being a distributed worker comes with its own set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My truest challenge in this new lifestyle is knowing when it’s time to ignore Slack, shut off email, take off the Pebble, and just spend time with my family. It’s a challenge I’m learning to face, and the hardest part is admitting to myself that it’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s come up in conversation a couple times with my wife, and every time, she lets me know when I’m failing. Honesty here is the key. Not guilt, not anger, just brutal honesty of when I’m not being the best husband and dad because I’m putting work before them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges a distributed worker faces is figuring out the balance between work, family, and personal life. If you&amp;#8217;re struggling to find balance, I encourage you to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-mantra-of-family-comes-first&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and the nearly 100 comments that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments are from people in similar positions trying to figure out how to balance work, life, and family. After nearly three years of being a distributed worker, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Bug in Chrome 45 Causes WordPress Admin Menu to Break</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48045</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-bug-in-chrome-45-causes-wordpress-admin-menu-to-break</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Within the last five weeks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33199&quot;&gt;several people have reported&lt;/a&gt; an issue in Chrome that breaks the WordPress admin menu. If you hover the mouse cursor over menu items in the sidebar, they&amp;#8217;ll occasionally fall out-of-place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48046&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png?resize=764%2C543&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome WordPress Admin Menu &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using Chrome 45.0.2454.85, I&amp;#8217;m able to inconsistently reproduce the behaviour reported in the ticket. Through the process of elimination, users discovered Chrome is the software at fault and not WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179#c17&quot;&gt;source of the problem&lt;/a&gt; stems from Slimming Paint which is enabled by default in Chrome 45. Disabling slimming paint fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable this feature, visit &lt;strong&gt;chrome://flags/#disable-slimming-paint&lt;/strong&gt; in Chrome and &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Disable slimming paint&lt;/em&gt; option, and make sure the other two &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; options are disabled because they will override the Disable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds confusing, please refer to the following screenshot provided by Samuel Wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48056&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png?resize=839%2C185&quot; alt=&quot;Disable Slimming Paint Options&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Disable Slimming Paint Options
&lt;p&gt;Chrome&amp;#8217;s development team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179&amp;q=label%3AM-47%20slimming%20paint&amp;colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified&quot;&gt;aware of the issue&lt;/a&gt; and is working towards a solution that is marked for release in Chrome 47. Until then, users are encouraged to disable Slimming Paint until Chrome fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Dashboard Widget That Displays New Registered Users</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48037</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-dashboard-widget-that-displays-new-registered-users</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you run a WordPress site with user registration enabled and want to see recently registered accounts from the dashboard, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/new-user-dashboard/&quot;&gt;New User Dashboard Widget plugin&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/swadeshswain/&quot;&gt;Swadeshswain&lt;/a&gt;. After installing and activating the plugin, a new registered user widget appears on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48038&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png?resize=536%2C146&quot; alt=&quot;New Registered User Widget&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New Registered User Widget
&lt;p&gt;The widget tells you a user&amp;#8217;s registration date, name, and role. If you don&amp;#8217;t see the widget after activating the plugin, click on the Screen Options tab and make sure the box next to New User is checked. New User Dashboard Widget is the type of plugin that does one thing only and does it well. There&amp;#8217;s nothing to configure and it works out-of-the-box with WordPress 4.3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Proposal to Overhaul the Shortcode API in WordPress Goes Back to the Drawing Board</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48026</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/proposal-to-overhaul-the-shortcode-api-in-wordpress-goes-back-to-the-drawing-board</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/miqrogroove&quot;&gt;Robert Chapin&lt;/a&gt;, who contributes to WordPress core, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;published the first draft&lt;/a&gt; of a roadmap that explains how the Shortcode API could be overhauled. &amp;#8220;The decision to create this roadmap arose from specific needs that are not met by the old code,&amp;#8221; Chapin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has an aggressive timeline with development starting in WordPress 4.4 and ending in WordPress 4.7. In WordPress 4.4, a new syntax would be introduced that provides opportunities to make significant changes to the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of shortcodes that use the new syntax.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Self-Closing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode attr1=&amp;#8221;value1&amp;#8243; attr2=&amp;#8217;value2&amp;#8242; &amp;#8220;value3&amp;#8221; &amp;#8216;value4&amp;#8217; value5}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Enclosures&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${encl2}$] HTML [${encl3}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escaped Code&lt;/strong&gt;: [!{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the WordPress 4.5 development cycle, the focus would be to deprecate the old syntax, &amp;#8220;Plugins that register shortcodes without declaring support for new features will raise debugging errors to alert developers that support for the old shortcode syntax is ending,&amp;#8221; Chapin said. Posts using the old syntax would  continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the WordPress 4.6 update process, shortcodes using the old syntax would be converted to use the new syntax. The Shortcode API would continue to provide deprecated support for the old syntax to provide a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important point to note is that the new syntax does not support HTML inside of shortcode attributes. This leaves the potential for many sites to break as shortcodes may not perform the same way prior to WordPress 4.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition process ends with WordPress 4.7 where support for the old syntax is eliminated. Shortcodes and plugins that use the old syntax would stop working. During the WordPress 4.7 update process, a second attempt would be made to upgrade old content to use the new syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Proposal Raises Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has drawn constructive criticism from several members of the WordPress community. Nick Haskins, founder of Aesop Interactive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27426&quot;&gt;voiced his concern&lt;/a&gt; saying the syntax isn&amp;#8217;t easier for authors to use and will affect a large number of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://halfelf.org/&quot;&gt;Mika Epstein&lt;/a&gt;, who voluntarily moderates the WordPress.org support forums and interacts with users on a daily basis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27472&quot;&gt;sums up a list of concerns&lt;/a&gt; that many developers agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the plugins and themes on the planet we will break (because we will, they won’t read or test). We have to degrade them as gracefully as humanly possibly. Continuing to say “Well the developers were notified and should have updated” now that we’re as big as we are is not sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the very (legitimately) angry end users who are broken because they didn’t upgrade plugins and themes (or the themes/plugins didn’t get updated). People were rightly angry last time. It’s the end users, not the developers, who will be hardest hit by this change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating clearly to the users that it’s now &lt;code&gt;{{gallery}}&lt;/code&gt;. That’s going to be very hard. Incredibly hard. Updating their old posts (keeping in mind Justin’s Markdown caveat and those who use them as an aside – I know I know) is easier than making sure everyone knows what to do. At best we can keep tabs on the ones built into WP and perhaps use the logic we have in the visual editor NOW to convert them, but we have to figure out how to make sure everyone knows. This is nothing like the move of Menus to customizer. That was confusing, but the users could see what happened. This is a legit change, your old way is no longer going to work. That is huge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of users who have premium themes and plugins that &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; get update alerts. These people are simply not going to know they need to update and this is not their fault. We should never be breaking them if there’s possibly any alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users will be upgraded by their hosts vis-a-vis one-click installs and managed hosting so they will have up to date WP and out of date plugins/themes. So yes, many users will be on 4.7 and then a theme from 2014. It sucks, it’s the reality, we know it’s the reality, we cannot stick our heads in the sand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugins that are already using {{template}} tags in their code. Yeah, I’ve seen it. Most of them use it for search/replace within their own code, but we’ll want to make sure we check for everyone in the repo who might be doing it on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best argument against using the new shortcode syntax is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27518&quot;&gt;made by Stefano Agiletti.&lt;/a&gt; Agiletti says Italian keyboards don&amp;#8217;t have keys that create curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe English people don’t know that { and } are not present in all keyboards directly as the [ and ] are. On Italian keyboards [ and ] are generated using ALT-GR+è or ALT-GR++ and keyboards show ALT-GR basic sign like €@## and [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get { and } you need to type ALT-GR+SHIFT+è and ALT-GR+SHIFT++. Most people don’t know about this combination (I think only those who write code do) and the parentheses are not written on any key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the Drawing Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a considerable amount of feedback and concerns shared by developers, the proposal is heading back to the drawing board. In a comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27484&quot;&gt;summarizing the feedback&lt;/a&gt;, Andrew Nacin confirms that the new shortcode syntax does not fit the core team&amp;#8217;s vision of being easy and intuitive for non-technical authors to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he cautions that the team needs to do something, &amp;#8220;The proposed syntax significantly clashes with the proposed vision and given all of your feedback, we’re clearly going to have to go back to the drawing board. Please note that &lt;strong&gt;we still need to do something&lt;/strong&gt;, but maybe we can think further outside the box.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly encourage you to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;proposal and the comments&lt;/a&gt; that follow it. It&amp;#8217;s a great read that highlights how difficult it will be to make changes to the Shortcode API that don&amp;#8217;t end up causing a lot of sites to break.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48012</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who regularly comment on the Tavern may have noticed that your comments don&amp;#8217;t show up immediately after submitting them. That&amp;#8217;s because about four weeks ago, for the first time in the Tavern&amp;#8217;s history, comment moderation for all comments was enabled. I enabled moderation to address concerns raised by members of the community and to sleep better at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the request of a few readers and to be more transparent, I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/comment-policy&quot;&gt;comment moderation policy&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of at least a dozen people, I&amp;#8217;ve crafted a policy that is easy to read and more importantly, easy to follow. It explains our expectations, has a few tips on writing better comments, and lists possible reasons a comment may be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;&gt;CC0 licensed&lt;/a&gt; which is the least restrictive license offered by Creative Commons. Feel free to copy and modify it for your own use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strive to create a fun, friendly, and inviting atmosphere. The ground rules for commenting on WP Tavern are simple. Treat people the way you want to be treated. Try to understand someone else’s perspective and if you disagree, respectfully explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text is a difficult medium to decipher context. Emoticons and emoji help, but it doesn’t solve the problem. Take a deep breath and assume the commenter has the best of intentions before responding and approach discussions with open minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome different perspectives and viewpoints but we all need to clearly communicate them without tearing the opposition down in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay on point using concise language. If your comment is more than a few paragraphs long, consider publishing it on your own site instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your comment may be deleted if it matches any of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocates an illegal practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses vulgar, profane, or unnecessarily harsh language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is spam or appears to be written primarily to post a link or advertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is written anonymously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains copyrighted material not licensed for distribution on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impersonates another user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains an affiliate link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal insults, including those using racist or sexist terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines are not meant to be an exhaustive list. The deletion of comments is wholly within the discretion of the moderators at WP Tavern and we will err on the side of maintaining a safe and friendly community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;How Do I Report Comments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe a comment published on WP Tavern violates any of the listed guidelines or that you feel needs special attention, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/contact-me&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;. Please do not publicly report comments using social media such as Facebook or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form submissions are sent to authors with comment moderation capabilities. Include a link to the comment in your email with a short explanation as to why it needs our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to reestablish the comment section as a place where people feel welcome to voice their opinions without the fear of being ripped apart. We encourage criticism, disagreements, and open conversation but it needs to take place in a respectful manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;A Day of REST&lt;/a&gt; will be the first ever event dedicated to the WordPress REST API. It&amp;#8217;ll happen on January 28th 2016, with a follow-on hack day on the 29th, and will be held at Bishopsgate Institute in London, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is aimed at developers who want to learn how to interact with the new WordPress REST API. From WordPress developers to Javascript developers, to application developers, A Day of REST promises to provide in-depth information that covers every aspect of the WordPress REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of event I&amp;#8217;ve been hoping to see in the WordPress community. Sessions will vary from an introduction to the WordPress REST API to in-depth case studies and guides on utilizing it in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an incredible and rare opportunity to learn from the people making the API and those extending it further than anyone else. A niche event to be sure, A Day of REST  is a big bet on the WordPress REST API &amp;#8212; which is not yet slated for core, but is widely expected to make it to core in the next few releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference is being organized to supply a clear demand for more information, resources, and education on the subject. At most WordCamps, REST API sessions seem to be some of the most crowded, with the most engaged and curious audiences. A Day of REST will be like those sessions, but much bigger, as the entire day will be dedicated to the single topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is speaking at A Day of REST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14179&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/speakers-day-of-rest-752x603.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;speakers-day-of-rest&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker roster consists of people who are building the WordPress REST API, and those who are already using it for production applications and websites. The speakers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan McCue &amp;#8211;  WordPress REST API co-lead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Hoyle &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Bachhuber &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen Vignos &amp;#8211; Director of Engineering, WIRED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K. Adam White &amp;#8211; Open Web Engineer, Bocoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Lenox &amp;#8211; Design Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Taylor &amp;#8211; Senior Engineer, New York Times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski &amp;#8211; Meta Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post Status will be an official partner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really pleased that Post Status will be the official content partner for A Day of REST. That means I’ll be attending the event, and I&amp;#8217;ll offer a number of in-depth posts related to the WordPress REST API, the sessions, interviews, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll also manage content for some of the larger event announcements, like this one. I&amp;#8217;ve known the organizers for a long time, and they are big supporters of Post Status. A Day of REST offers a really great opportunity for me to work with them and offer my readers some unique privileges and exclusive content for a subject that&amp;#8217;s of interest to most of my audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So who is organizing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14180&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/humans-752x333.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;humans&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/organizations/human-made/&quot;&gt;Human Made&lt;/a&gt;, who’ve brought on board &lt;a href=&quot;http://siobhanmckeown.com/about/&quot;&gt;Siobhan McKeown&lt;/a&gt; to lead the charge putting the event together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Made uses the API in a good bit of their services and product work, are really interested to see more adoption of the API, and are eager to provide education resources so that can happen. Those of you who pay close attention may know that two of Human Made&amp;#8217;s own are actually part of the team of four that does much of the REST API development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rmccue&quot;&gt;Ryan McCue&lt;/a&gt; is the project co-lead, and is generally steering the ship; the API started as his GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle&quot;&gt;Joe Hoyle&lt;/a&gt; is in day to day conversations for project direction and also commits a lot of code to the API; he is a co-founder of Human Made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hack Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 29th January 2016, there will be a WordPress REST API hack day. This event is being hosted by Mozilla Spaces in London. Space for the hack day is limited but the team would love for anyone interested to come along and help make the WordPress REST API. Bring a laptop and expect to get hacking. This event will be for building the REST API specifically, and not geared toward other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ticket details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/tickets/&quot;&gt;from the website&lt;/a&gt;. They’re £125 (+ VAT &amp;amp; booking fees) &amp;#8212; which ends up being around $235 US &amp;#8212; and the price includes all of the usual conference goodies: presentations, lunch, swag, and an informal afterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confirmed sponsors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is excited to already have some awesome sponsors on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prospress.com/&quot;&gt;ProsPress&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sucuri.net/&quot;&gt;Sucuri&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is also looking for more sponsors to get involved and help make this unique event happen. If you’d like to sponsor, send an email to events@humanmade.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the content, you can get updates either from this blog, or from the A Day of REST website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;feelingrestful.com&lt;/a&gt;. You should also follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/feelingrestful&quot;&gt;@feelingrestful&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for live updates. I&amp;#8217;ll have in-depth content and broader event information and the event site will have more general announcements, news, and event updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is quite accessible from much of the world, so I am hopeful and confident that there will be a diverse audience in attendance. I certainly look forward to visiting; and I was pleasantly surprised that it doesn&amp;#8217;t get as cold there as I thought; January temperatures (lows and highs) stay around the 40s (F, or 5-9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_default&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_unit_c&quot;&gt;°&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; C) &amp;#8212; which is likely warmer than it&amp;#8217;ll be where I live in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is an exciting development in the WordPress conference ecosystem and I&amp;#8217;m confident it&amp;#8217;s going to be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Envato Implements Item Support Policy for ThemeForest and CodeCanyon</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47990</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/envato-implements-item-support-policy-for-themeforest-and-codecanyon</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In August of 2014, Envato &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/news/item-support-sustainability-authors-clarity-buyers/&quot;&gt;announced a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; that would allow sellers on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codecanyon.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;CodeCanyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;ThemeForest&lt;/a&gt; to inform buyers whether or not an item is supported. Earlier today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/releases/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/&quot;&gt;Envato implemented&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;Item Support Policy&lt;/a&gt; for sellers on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When browsing items on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, a blue badge indicates the seller provides support. There&amp;#8217;s also a badge and text that informs potential buyers if an item is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47991&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png?resize=639%2C408&quot; alt=&quot;This Item is Supported&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This Item is Supported
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt;, buyers automatically receive six months of support from the date of purchase. If you need support for an entire year, you can buy an extension for a nominal upgrade fee. Envato takes 30% and gives 70% of the purchase to authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of a &lt;b&gt;6-month support extension&lt;/b&gt; for a &lt;b&gt;Regular License&lt;/b&gt; is calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37.5% of the item price (30% of the list price) when purchased at the same time as the license;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;62.5% of the item price (50% of the list price) when purchased during the support period; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87.5% of the item price (70% of the list price) when purchased after the support period has ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Freeman, product manager for Envato, says the changes provide a standardized definition of support, &amp;#8220;Buyers will know exactly what to expect from all purchases on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers who purchased supported items before the new policy went into effect have six months of free tech support starting on September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disgruntled Authors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.envato.com/t/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/3619&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; with over 165 responses, sellers discussed the pros and cons of the policy while some expressed anger. &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/user/jonathan01&quot;&gt;Jonathan Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr3ativ.com/&quot;&gt;Cr3ativ&lt;/a&gt;, who sells several items on ThemeForest, thinks the policy is not as good as alternatives offered outside of the marketplaces because of its confusing complexity for both authors and buyers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure why Envato chose this solution when we already have a well established support/upgrade system in place within most of the WordPress community where 12 months of support is included in the purchase and customers receive a 50% discount to continue receiving support and updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is a work in progress, &amp;#8220;We will be monitoring the impacts of this change very closely and will be tweaking, improving and enhancing the support tools over coming weeks and months,&amp;#8221; Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a buyer or seller on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, let us know what you think of the support policy in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Twenty Sixteen Now Available on GitHub and the WordPress Theme Directory</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47973</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/twenty-sixteen-now-available-on-github-and-the-wordpress-theme-directory</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen, the default theme scheduled to ship with WordPress 4.4, is available for download on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/&quot;&gt;WordPress theme directory&lt;/a&gt;. According &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/29/twenty-sixteen-is-now-on-github/&quot;&gt;to Tammie Lister&lt;/a&gt;, Twenty Sixteen will be developed as if it were a feature plugin and will merge into WordPress core later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development takes place on GitHub, changes will regularly sync up to the WordPress theme directory. By installing and activating Twenty Sixteen from the theme directory, users can easily update to new versions as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Twenty Sixteen has 23 issues and 27 pull requests on GitHub. Many of the issues such as, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/pull/23&quot;&gt;introducing automated Travis CI build testing into Twenty Sixteen,&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/labels/discussion&quot;&gt;up for discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the top half of the Tavern looks like with Twenty Sixteen activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47974&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=1025%2C563&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the content section looks like. Notice the block of code that displays instead of an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47976&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=881%2C648&quot; alt=&quot;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen Activated
&lt;p&gt;Testers are encouraged to open issues and pull requests on GitHub. If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with how GitHub works, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; explains how to contribute to the Twenty Sixteen project. Keep in mind that Twenty Sixteen is a work in progress and should not be used in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Great jazz cover of one of my favorite Kendrick Lamar songs, Rigamortis, which of course is inspired by the great jazz song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=27&amp;v=TstRwZygLAo&quot;&gt;The Thorn by Willie Jones III&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress.com Unveils the Action Bar</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47954</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-unveils-the-action-bar</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/new-action-bar/&quot;&gt;unveiled a new user interface&lt;/a&gt; called the Action Bar. It&amp;#8217;s a bar that shows up in the bottom right corner of the screen for logged in users and is accessible from any device. The bar performs multiple tasks depending on the page you&amp;#8217;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47955&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WordPressComActionBar.png?resize=1025%2C627&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress Action Bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress Action Bar
&lt;p&gt;When on a WordPress.com powered site that you&amp;#8217;re not following, the bar turns into a Follow button. Clicking the follow button will notify you of new posts published on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47956&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/actionbar-follow.png?resize=192%2C60&quot; alt=&quot;Action Bar Follow Button&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Action Bar Follow Button
&lt;p&gt;If you click the three dots to the right, you&amp;#8217;ll see a variety of options depending upon the page you&amp;#8217;re viewing. If it&amp;#8217;s the homepage, you&amp;#8217;ll see links to download the theme the site uses, report the content, or manage the sites you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re browsing a specific post on a WordPress.com site, you&amp;#8217;ll see an additional link to copy a shortlink for quick and easy sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47957&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarThreeDots.png?resize=265%2C319&quot; alt=&quot;Easily Share Posts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easily Share Posts
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com and are logged in, the Follow button turns into a Customize button. This link provides a quick way to enter the Customizer. There&amp;#8217;s also an Edit link if you&amp;#8217;re browsing a published post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47958&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ActionBarEditCustomizeButton.png?resize=307%2C348&quot; alt=&quot;Edit and Customize Links&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Edit and Customize Links
&lt;p&gt;If the action bar is too big and you want to minimize it, click the three dots and select the option to Collapse the bar. It will shrink the bar into squares and get out of your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the action bar is the ability to quickly see and download a theme used on a WordPress.com site. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work for WordPress.com specific sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailypost.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;The Daily Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What annoys me about the action bar is that it disappears when I scroll down. I caught myself scrolling down to read a post and when I looked for the edit button to fix a typo, the action bar was gone. I think it should stay on the screen at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to see the Edit link in the action bar open a front-end editor. It&amp;#8217;s time WordPress.com step up its game and stop forcing users through a backend interface to edit published content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the experimental action bar but at the same time, I question the reasoning for adding yet another user interface element to mimic actions already supported by other buttons and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, between the admin bar, dashboard, the edit link underneath a post, and the action bar, there are now four different ways to edit a post. How many roads are necessary to reach the same destination?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a site on WordPress.com, let me know what you think of the action bar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.3.1 also fixes twenty-six bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.3.1">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.3/?rev=34199&amp;stop_rev=33647">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.3.1</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.3.1.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard.

<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>

<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.4 also fixes four bugs. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.4">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33573&amp;stop_rev=33396">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.4</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.4.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who contributed to 4.2.3:</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em>Site icons for all</em><br />
<em>Live preview menu changes</em><br />

<p>WordPress 4.3.1 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses three issues, including two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential privilege escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress versions 4.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when processing shortcode tags (CVE-2015-5714). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
<li>A separate cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the user list table. Reported by Ben Bidner of the WordPress security team.</li>
<li>Finally, in certain cases, users without proper permissions could publish private posts and make them sticky (CVE-2015-5715). Reported by Shahar Tal and Netanel Rubin of <a href="http://checkpoint.com/">Check Point</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>

<p>Version 4.3 of WordPress, named &#8220;Billie&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, is available for <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download</a> or update in your WordPress dashboard.

<hr />
<h2>Menus in the Customizer</h2>
<div><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/menu-customizer.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Create your menu, update it, and assign it, all while live-previewing in the customizer. The streamlined customizer design provides a mobile-friendly and accessible interface. With every release, it becomes easier and faster to make your site just the way you want it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formatting Shortcuts</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0"><div style="width: 640px; " class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-3845-1" width="640" height="360" loop="1" autoplay="1" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4?_=1" /><source type="video/webm" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.webm?_=1" /><source type="video/ogg" src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4">//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/formatting.mp4</a></video></div></div>
<p>Your writing flow just got faster with new formatting shortcuts in WordPress 4.3. Use asterisks to create lists and number signs to make a heading. No more breaking your flow; your text looks great with a <code>*</code> and a <code>#</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Site Icons</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/site-icon-customizer.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Site icons represent your site in browser tabs, bookmark menus, and on the home screen of mobile devices. Add your unique site icon in the customizer; it will even stay in place when you switch themes. Make your whole site reflect your brand.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Better Passwords</h2>
<p><img src="//s.w.org/images/core/4.3/better-passwords.png" alt="" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Keep your site more secure with WordPress’ improved approach to passwords. Instead of receiving passwords via email, you’ll get a password reset link. When you add new users to your site or edit a user profile, WordPress will automatically generate a secure password.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A smoother admin experience</strong> &#8211; Refinements to the list view across the admin make your WordPress more accessible and easier to work with on any device.</li>
<li><strong>Comments turned off on pages</strong> &#8211; All new pages that you create will have comments turned off. Keep discussions to your blog, right where they’re supposed to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your site quickly</strong> &#8211; Wherever you are on the front-end, you can click the customize link in the toolbar to swiftly make changes to your site.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>The Team</h2>
<p><a class="alignleft" href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/obenland"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2370ea5912750f4cb0f3c51ae1cbca55?d=mm&amp;s=180&amp;r=G" alt="Konstantin Obenland" width="80" height="80" /></a>This release was led by <a href="http://konstantin.obenland.it/">Konstantin Obenland</a>, with the help of these fine individuals.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.4 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>This release addresses six issues, including three cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a potential SQL injection that could be used to compromise a site, which were discovered by <a href="https://sucuri.net/">Marc-Alexandre Montpas</a> of Sucuri, <a href="http://helenhousandi.com/">Helen Hou-Sandí</a> of the WordPress security team, <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Netanel Rubin</a> of Check Point, and <a href="https://hackerone.com/reactors08">Ivan Grigorov</a>. It also includes a fix for a potential timing side-channel attack, discovered by <a href="http://www.scrutinizer-ci.com/">Johannes Schmitt</a> of Scrutinizer, and prevents an attacker from locking a post from being edited, discovered by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/symbiansymoh">Mohamed A. Baset</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.2.3 is now available. This is a<strong> security release</strong> for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.</p>
<p>WordPress versions 4.2.2 and earlier are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability, which could allow users with the Contributor or Author role to compromise a site. This was initially reported by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/duck_">Jon Cave</a> and fixed by <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, both of the WordPress security team, and later reported by <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>.</p>
<p>We also fixed an issue where it was possible for a user with Subscriber permissions to create a draft through Quick Draft. Reported by Netanel Rubin from <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to those who have practiced <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">responsible disclosure</a> of security issues.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2.3 also contains fixes for 20 bugs from 4.2. For more information, see the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2.3">release notes</a> or consult the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.2?rev=33382&amp;stop_rev=32430">list of changes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.2.3</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and simply click “Update Now.” Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update to WordPress 4.2.3.</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta2.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>For more information about what’s new in version 4.3, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/07/wordpress-4-3-beta-1/">check out the Beta 1 blog post</a>. Some of the changes in Beta 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in beta 1 where an alert appeared when saving or publishing a new post/page for the first time.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Customizer</strong></strong> improvements including enhanced accessibility, smoother menu creation and location assignment, and the ability to handle nameless menus. Please help us test menus in the Customizer to fix any remaining edge cases!</li>
<li>More robust<strong> list tables</strong> with full content support on small screens and a fallback for the primary column for custom list tables. We&#8217;d love to know how these list tables, such as All Posts and Comments, work for you now on small screen devices.</li>
<li>The <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature has been improved so that cropping is skipped if the image is the exact size (512px square) and the media modal now suggests a minimum icon size. Please let us know how the flow feels and if you encounter any glitches!</li>
<li>The <strong>toolbar</strong> now has a direct link to the customizer, along with quick access to themes, widgets, and menus in the dashboard.</li>
<li>We enabled <strong>utf8mb4 for MySQL</strong> extension users, which was previously unintentionally limited to MySQLi users. Please let us know if you run into any issues.</li>
<li><strong>Various bug fixes</strong>. We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=33138&amp;stop_rev=33046">almost 100 changes</a> in the last week.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.3 Beta 1 is now available!</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 4.3, try the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.3-beta1.zip">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>4.3 is due out next month, but to get there, we need your help testing what we&#8217;ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Menus</strong> can now be managed with the <strong>Customizer</strong>, which allows you to live preview changes you’re making without changing your site for visitors until you’re ready. We&#8217;re especially interested to know if this helps streamline the process of setting up your site (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32576">#32576</a>).</li>
<li>Take control of another piece of your site with the <strong>Site Icon</strong> feature. You can now manage your site’s favicon and app icon from the admin area (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16434">#16434</a>).</li>
<li>We put a lot of work into <strong>Better Passwords</strong> throughout WordPress. Now, WordPress will limit the life time of password resets, no longer send passwords via email, and generate and suggest secure passwords for you. Try it out and let us know what you think! (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32589">#32589</a>)</li>
<li>We’ve also added <strong>Editor Improvements</strong>. Certain text patterns are automatically transformed as you type, including <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> transforming into unordered lists, <code>1.</code> and <code>1)</code> for ordered lists, <code>&gt;</code> for blockquotes and two to six number signs (<code>#</code>) for headings (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31441">#31441</a>).</li>
<li>We’ve improved the <strong>list view</strong> across the admin dashboard. Now, when you view your posts and pages <strong>on small screen devices</strong>, columns are not truncated and can be toggled into view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32395">#32395</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>: There have been a few of changes for you to test as well, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxonomy Roadmap:</strong> Terms shared across multiple taxonomies will <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/eliminating-shared-taxonomy-terms-in-wordpress-4-3/">now be split</a> into separate terms on update to 4.3. Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30261">#30261</a>).</li>
<li>Added <code>singular.php</code> to the template hierarchy as a fallback for <code>single.php</code> and <code>page.php</code>. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22314">#22314</a>).</li>
<li>The old Distraction Free Writing code was removed (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30949">#30949</a>).</li>
<li>List tables now can (and often should) have a primary column defined. We’re working on a fallback for existing custom list tables but right now they likely have some breakage in the aforementioned responsive view (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25408">#25408</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what changes have made it into 4.3, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-3/">check out all 4.3-tagged posts</a> on the main development blog.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We’d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=4.3">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

	<title>WPTavern: 6 WordPress Plugins That Take Native Comments to the Next Level</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48414</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/6-wordpress-plugins-that-take-native-comments-to-the-next-level</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/lessons-i-learned-moderating-comments-in-wordpress&quot;&gt;shared the lessons I learned&lt;/a&gt; and the drawbacks to moderating comments in WordPress. In this post, I highlight six plugins that solve a problem I encountered or enhance comments for both readers and site administrators. All of the plugins are free of charge and available from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/&quot;&gt;WordPress plugin directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem Solvers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlPluginBanner.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48420&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlPluginBanner.png?resize=799%2C253&quot; alt=&quot;Crowd Control Plugin Banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I discovered that not all comments need to be moderated. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/crowd-control/&quot;&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt;, by Postmatic, gives readers the ability to report comments they feel don&amp;#8217;t adhere to a site&amp;#8217;s commenting policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When enabled, a new option is displayed on the &lt;strong&gt;General &amp;#8211; Discussion&lt;/strong&gt; settings page. You can configure how many reports a comment needs before it&amp;#8217;s sent to the moderation queue and whether administrators should be notified when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlSettings.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48421&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlSettings.png?resize=798%2C174&quot; alt=&quot;Crowd Control Settings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Crowd Control Settings
&lt;p&gt;If an administrator approves a comment that&amp;#8217;s in moderation due to hitting the threshold, it won&amp;#8217;t end up back in the moderation queue. This gives administrators the last word on whether a comment is acceptable or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlInAction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48422&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlInAction.png?resize=686%2C202&quot; alt=&quot;Crowd Control in Action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Crowd Control in Action
&lt;p&gt;If you think a comment needs an administrator&amp;#8217;s attention or does not adhere to the WP Tavern &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/comment-policy&quot;&gt;commenting policy&lt;/a&gt;, hover over the comment and click the report button. A new column is added to &lt;strong&gt;edit-comments.php&lt;/strong&gt; that displays how many reports a comment has. It&amp;#8217;s important to note that detailed information of who reported the comment is not saved to the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlReportedColumn.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48423&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrowdControlReportedColumn.png?resize=807%2C193&quot; alt=&quot;Reported Comments Column&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reported Comments Column
&lt;p&gt;The system is open for abuse but I trust that the Tavern readership will use it responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Show Parent Comment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments that are pending moderation in the WordPress backend that are in response to another comment are hard to moderate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;Show Parent Comment&lt;/a&gt;, developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/stephencronin/&quot;&gt;Stephen Cronin&lt;/a&gt;, adds a &lt;strong&gt;Show More&lt;/strong&gt; dropdown to the &lt;strong&gt;edit-comments.php&lt;/strong&gt; screen that allows administrators to see the text of the comment that a person is responding too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/6-wordpress-plugins-that-take-native-comments-to-the-next-level#gallery-48414-1-slideshow&quot;&gt;Click to view slideshow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve used this plugin for more than two weeks and I enjoy the user interface. It looks and acts as if it&amp;#8217;s a natural part of WordPress. Chris Christoff &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33627&quot;&gt;created a ticket&lt;/a&gt; in Trac with the suggestion that a user interface element like the one in Cronin&amp;#8217;s plugin be added to core. If you have feedback on the best way to accomplish this, please add it to the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enhancements to Native Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Epoch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EpochPluginBanner.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48415&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EpochPluginBanner.png?resize=806%2C255&quot; alt=&quot;Epoch Plugin Banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/epoch/&quot;&gt;Epoch&lt;/a&gt; is a plugin developed by Postmatic and a few other contributors that enhances WordPress&amp;#8217; comment system. Unlike services such as Disqus or Livefyre that replace the comment system, Epoch adds features to WordPress&amp;#8217; native comments. This allows you to keep comments within your database at all times without relying on a third-party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epoch applies a series of visual enhancements to the comment form. Replies from the post author are a different color from regular responses and the date and time the comment is written is displayed at the top. Epoch also uses Ajax to send and receive comments which eliminates the need to refresh the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/6-wordpress-plugins-that-take-native-comments-to-the-next-level#gallery-48414-2-slideshow&quot;&gt;Click to view slideshow.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epoch has a front end moderation capability that allows site administrators to approve, trash, or spam comments. Unlike the native comment form, Epoch doesn&amp;#8217;t load the comments unless the browser reaches a certain point on a post or is accessed via a direct link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most instances, the comment form loads quickly but on certain mobile devices, the lack of speed is noticeable. The team is aware of the performance issues and is attacking the problem with a three stage approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epoch relies on JavaScript to function so if a visitor browsing your site has JavaScript disabled, the comments don&amp;#8217;t load. Again, the team is aware of this issue and is creating a fallback to WordPress&amp;#8217; native comment system if the files can&amp;#8217;t be retrieved from its CDN or JavaScript is disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Basic Comment Quicktags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BasicCommentQuicktagPluginBanner.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48426&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BasicCommentQuicktagPluginBanner.png?resize=769%2C251&quot; alt=&quot;Basic Comment Quicktag Plugin Banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In WordPress 4.3, the allowed HTML tags text displayed near the comment form &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30157&quot;&gt;was removed&lt;/a&gt;. The tags were removed because they&amp;#8217;re note relevant and confusing to most users. While I agree that the text is not relevant, I think the comment form should have basic text formatting buttons so readers don&amp;#8217;t have to remember and manually type HTML tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BasicCommentQuicktagsOnTheTavern.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48428&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BasicCommentQuicktagsOnTheTavern.png?resize=665%2C368&quot; alt=&quot;Basic Comment Quicktags in Action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Basic Comment Quicktags in Action
&lt;p&gt;Once Basic Comment Quicktags is installed, navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Settings &amp;#8211; Discussion&lt;/strong&gt; and check the box to enable them for comments. When enabled, the comment text area will have Bold, Italic, Link and Quote buttons. The best part of this plugin is that it exposes a built-in core feature using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/Quicktags_API&quot;&gt;Quicktags API&lt;/a&gt; added to WordPress 3.3. Text formatting buttons in the comment area is a courtesy I&amp;#8217;d like more site owners to give to readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simple Comment Editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SimpleCommentEditingPluginBanner.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48429&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SimpleCommentEditingPluginBanner.png?resize=764%2C262&quot; alt=&quot;Simple Comment Editing Plugin Banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-comment-editing/&quot;&gt;Simple Comment Editing&lt;/a&gt;, developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/ronalfy/&quot;&gt;Ronald Huereca&lt;/a&gt;, adds the ability for readers to edit their comments in a limited time frame. By default, readers have five minutes to edit their comment once it&amp;#8217;s submitted. Although no configuration is necessary, you can alter the time and behavior of the plugin by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ronalfy/simple-comment-editing#wordpress-filters&quot;&gt;actions and filters&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve changed the time limit to 15 minutes on the Tavern to make sure readers have plenty of time to make edits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SimpleCommentEditingInAction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48430&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SimpleCommentEditingInAction.png?resize=676%2C173&quot; alt=&quot;Simple Comment Editing Countdown Timer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Simple Comment Editing Countdown Timer
&lt;p&gt;With Simple Comment Editing installed, the amount of contact form submissions and requests to edit a comment have gone down considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Postmatic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostmaticPluginBanner.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48432&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostmaticPluginBanner.png?resize=801%2C235&quot; alt=&quot;Postmatic Plugin Banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic/&quot;&gt;Postmatic&lt;/a&gt; is a plugin that &lt;a href=&quot;https://gopostmatic.com/&quot;&gt;ties into a service&lt;/a&gt; and has a number of features. Readers can subscribe to posts or to comments and receive updates via email. Postmatic has a beautiful email template that shows the most recent reply, the commenter&amp;#8217;s Gravatar, and a recap of the post and conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostmaticCommentEmailTemplate.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48433&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PostmaticCommentEmailTemplate.png?resize=727%2C833&quot; alt=&quot;Postmatic Comment Email Template&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Postmatic Comment Email Template
&lt;p&gt;Readers can respond to comments via email without having to visit the comment form. Site administrators can reply, trash, or submit comments to Akismet via email. It&amp;#8217;s important to note that Postmatic is not a third-party commenting service. Instead, it uses the native comment system in WordPress allowing you to keep and own your data at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I moderate comments from the WordPress mobile app or the WordPress backend, Postmatic is a great fallback. I also think the email template looks great and offers a better user experience than the comment notification emails provided by WordPress. Postmatic &lt;a href=&quot;https://gopostmatic.com/technology/&quot;&gt;does a lot more&lt;/a&gt; than what I describe above but for the purpose of this article, I focused on the comment portion of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postmatic is a new addition to the Tavern that I encourage you to try. After trying it out, please tell me about your experience. I especially wany to know if it&amp;#8217;s easier to keep track of and take part in conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;Notifications That a Comment in Moderation is Approved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems I&amp;#8217;ve yet to solve is being addressed by a number of WordPress contributors in &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717#comment:6&quot;&gt;ticket 33717&lt;/a&gt;. If all goes well, it&amp;#8217;s possible this feature will be added to WordPress 4.4. Once added, readers whose comments end up in the moderation queue will automatically be notified by WordPress when it&amp;#8217;s approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It’s Not Perfect but It&amp;#8217;s an Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all the features these plugins provide, I don&amp;#8217;t think the comment system in WordPress or the form on WP Tavern is perfect. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if perfection of either can be achieved. However, I think both are improvements over the previous iterations. If there&amp;#8217;s a plugin you use to improve WordPress&amp;#8217; native comments or its moderation system, let me know about it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Donncha: The Web Won’t Forget Alex King</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you use a WordPress site, either as a visitor or owner, you&amp;#8217;re using code that &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/&quot;&gt;Alex King&lt;/a&gt;, one of the original developers of WordPress, worked on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He passed away after fighting &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;cancer for 2 years&lt;/a&gt; but his online presence lives on in the form of his blog with it&amp;#8217;s deep archive of posts going back years, and in so much code that it&amp;#8217;s humbling to look at his &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/projects&quot;&gt;projects page&lt;/a&gt;. Looking through the svn log of WordPress trunk shows he still had a hand in helping the WordPress project until relatively recently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;trunk$ svn log|grep alexkingorg&lt;br /&gt;
props alexkingorg for the initial, long-suffering patch.&lt;br /&gt;
props alexkingorg. fixes &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24162&quot;&gt;#24162&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Props alexkingorg&lt;br /&gt;
`wp.media` instead of just `media`. props alexkingorg, see #22676.&lt;br /&gt;
Add $post_ID context to the pre_ping filter. props alexkingorg, devesine. fixes #18506.&lt;br /&gt;
Add filter so the users can select custom image sizes added by themes and plugins, props alexkingorg, fixes #18520&lt;br /&gt;
esc_textarea() and application for obvious textarea escaping. props alexkingorg. fixes #15454&lt;br /&gt;
Escape links by default.  Props alexkingorg. see #13051&lt;br /&gt;
Safely include class-json.php, class-simplepie.php and class-snoopy.php, props alexkingorg, fixes #11827&lt;br /&gt;
Fix user creation from admin after changes for #10751. Fixes #10811 props alexkingorg.&lt;br /&gt;
Hooks needed to allow alternate category admin inteface. Props alexkingorg. fixes #3408&lt;br /&gt;
Wrap cat name in CDATA. props alexkingorg.  fixes #3252&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sorry I never met Alex, however I remember working virtually with him and Adam Tow on AllThingsD which seems like a lifetime away now. Adam has &lt;a href=&quot;http://tow.com/2015/09/28/remembering-alex-king/&quot;&gt;a great article&lt;/a&gt; on Alex on his blog, as does Matt &lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2015/09/remembering-alex-king/&quot;&gt;who went into detail&lt;/a&gt; about Alex&amp;#8217;s involvement with WordPress going back to the days of b2. I had completely forgotten &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition&quot;&gt;the CSS competition&lt;/a&gt; he mentioned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex, your legacy lives on. &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress 4.4 Removes the View Post and Get Shortlink Buttons From the Post Editor</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48395</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-4-removes-the-view-post-and-get-shortlink-buttons-from-the-post-editor</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In WordPress 4.4, the View Post button in the post editor is disappearing in favor of a clickable permalink. Four years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scribu.net/&quot;&gt;Scribu&lt;/a&gt;, who is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scribu.net/blog/left-wordpress.html&quot;&gt;former WordPress contributor&lt;/a&gt;, created ticket &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18306&quot;&gt;#18306&lt;/a&gt;. In the ticket, Scribu explains that the View Post button is redundant functionality and suggests that it be removed in favor of a clickable permalink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two screenshots of the post editor. The first is WordPress 4.3 and the second is WordPress 4.4. Clicking the permalink allows you to preview the post in its current state. Notice the slug part of the URL is in bold. You need to click the Edit button to edit the permalink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WP43PermalinkEditor.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-48397 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WP43PermalinkEditor.png?resize=568%2C213&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.3 Post Editor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Post Editor
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WP44PermalinkEditor.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-48398 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WP44PermalinkEditor.png?resize=570%2C188&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.4 Post Editor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.4 Post Editor
&lt;p&gt;Not only does this change remove redundant functionality, it removes a UI element from the page. Enhancements like these are a huge win for WordPress because it makes the interface simpler without permanently removing the button&amp;#8217;s purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the View Post button, the Get Shortlink button is also removed. The button shows up if you’re using a custom shortlink and can be re-enabled using code or a plugin. For most users, the Edit button is the only one they&amp;#8217;ll see between the post title and content box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect some users will be frustrated as they go through the process of changing their workflow but overall, I think it&amp;#8217;s a great improvement. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/&quot;&gt;WordPress beta testing plugin&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Westwood, I encourage you to set it to bleeding edge nightlies and update your site. You&amp;#8217;ll be able to test this change and others during the WordPress 4.4 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Remembering Alex King</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45372</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/09/remembering-alex-king/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ma.tt/2009/05/wordcamp-sf-2009-2/mcm_0235-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2009/05/MCM_0235.JPG?resize=276%2C415&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alex speaking at WordCamp SF 2009One of the original WordPress developers, Alex King, has passed &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;from cancer&lt;/a&gt; at far too young an age. Alex actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2002/10/24/b2-coding&quot;&gt;got involved with b2 in 2002&lt;/a&gt; and was active in the forums and the &amp;#8220;hacks&amp;#8221; community there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex had a background as a designer before he learned development, and I think that really came through as he was one of those rare people who thought about the design and usability of his code, the opposite of most development that drifts toward entropy and complexity. One of my favorite things about Alex was how &lt;em&gt;darn tasteful&lt;/em&gt; he was. He would think about every aspect of something he built, every place someone could click, every path they could go down, and gave a thoughtfulness to these paths that I still admire and envy today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example look&amp;nbsp;at his &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/project/post-formats-admin-ui&quot;&gt;project page (essentially a category archive) for the Post Formats Admin UI&lt;/a&gt;, isn&amp;#8217;t that clever and intuitive how the posts connect together, and when more time passes in the thread it&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudup.com/ceWJeb9zcK6&quot;&gt;shown as a break&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s classic Alex: something simple and thoughtful that in hindsight is so gobsmackingly obvious you wonder why everything doesn&amp;#8217;t work that way, but you never would have imagined it beforehand. And Alex wouldn&amp;#8217;t just imagine it and do it for himself, he released his best work as open source, as a gift to the community and the world, over and over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when WordPress was getting started Alex was a celebrity of the b2 world, his hacks (plugins before plugins) were&amp;nbsp;some of the coolest ones around. We had a ton of overlapping interests in web standards, photography, development, and gadgets so&amp;nbsp;we frequently read and commented on each other&amp;#8217;s blogs. I would never miss a post on his site, and that&amp;#8217;s back when we were both doing one or more posts a day. To get a sense of Alex it&amp;#8217;s worth &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog&quot;&gt;exploring his blog&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; he was a clear thinker and therefore a clear writer.&amp;nbsp;The straightforward nature Alex wrote with was something I always admired about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2003/07/08/wordpress-development&quot;&gt;discussed WordPress early on&lt;/a&gt;, Alex &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2003/07/23/wordpress-hacks&quot;&gt;signed up to help with what later became the plugin directory&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition&quot;&gt;his CSS competition&lt;/a&gt; (look at those prizes! and notice it&amp;#8217;s all GPL) was hugely influential on the path to themes, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2003/08/15/wordpress-dev&quot;&gt;he officially became a contributing developer in August of 2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of what Alex was one of the first to do in the WordPress community is long, and &lt;em&gt;in hindsight&lt;/em&gt; seems gobsmackingly obvious, which is the sign of innovation. I smile when I think of how he &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2003/10/02/moving-to-denver&quot;&gt;moved from the Bay area to Denver&lt;/a&gt; before it was cool, or his &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudup.com/cL9v2RKEI0T&quot;&gt;love of scare quotes&lt;/a&gt;. Once there was something going on in WordPress and he called me to talk about it, I was so surprised, he said the number was right on my contact page (and it was) but even though it had been there for years no one had ever called it before, but that was just the type of person Alex was, always reaching out and connecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://atow.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2007-04-16_2122-18_8683.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adam Tow, myself, Barry Abrahamson, Alex King; Photo from &lt;a href=&quot;http://tow.com/2015/09/28/remembering-alex-king/&quot;&gt;Adam Tow&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure how to include this next part: I couldn&amp;#8217;t write last night &amp;#8212; I was too tired. After falling&amp;nbsp;asleep I had one of those super vivid dreams that you can&amp;#8217;t tell are dreams. There had been some sort of mix-up on Twitter and Alex was still alive, I&amp;nbsp;visited Colorado with my sister and saw him surrounded by family at a picnic table, all the rooms were taken so they put me on a floor mattress where I slept. Tons of his friends were around and we took pictures together, he was excited about the better front&amp;nbsp;camera on the 6s+. (Alex understood&amp;nbsp;mobile all the way back to the Treo days.) It was all very ordinary and in a group setting, until we decided to walk alongside a small highway, past some grain silos, to meet the group at a bar. The walk was just the two of us and we talked and&amp;nbsp;laughed about the big mix-up and he asked about this post, what was going to be in it. He got most excited and emphatic with the part about him being a developer with great taste, and a clear writer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.williamzinsserwriter.com/&quot;&gt;William Zinsser&lt;/a&gt; would be proud of, so I like to think that those were two things he was proud of. The overwhelming emotion I remember was joy. Waking up was disconcerting, part of me wants to believe part of Alex&amp;#8217;s spirit was there, where another more logical part thinks my mind was&amp;nbsp;just going through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model&quot;&gt;the denial stage of grief&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless I know that Alex will stay in the minds of people who knew him for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code that Alex wrote still runs billions of times a day across millions of websites, and long after that code evolves or gets refactored the ideas and philosophy he embedded in WordPress will continue to be part of who we are. Alex believed so deeply in open source, and was one of the few people from a design background who did. (Every time you see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_icon&quot;&gt;the share icon&lt;/a&gt; on the web or in Android you should think of him.) I like the idea that part of his work will&amp;nbsp;continue in software for decades to come, but I&amp;#8217;d rather have him here, thinking outside the box and challenging us to do better, to be more obvious, and work harder for our users. He never gave up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Alex King, Founder of Crowd Favorite Passes Away</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48380</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/alex-king-founder-of-crowd-favorite-passes-away</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AlexKingWithDaughter.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48381&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/AlexKingWithDaughter.jpg?resize=620%2C360&quot; alt=&quot;Alex King with his daughter Heather&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alex King with his daughter Caitlin
&lt;p&gt;Alex King, who founded web development agency &lt;a href=&quot;https://crowdfavorite.com/&quot;&gt;Crowd Favorite,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/alexkingorg/&quot;&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of several WordPress themes and plugins &lt;a href=&quot;http://tow.com/2015/09/28/remembering-alex-king/&quot;&gt;passed away last night&lt;/a&gt; at his home. In January 2013, King was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer. He used his blog to tell the &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/thread/cancer&quot;&gt;story of his fight to stay alive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 24th, King &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/cycle-1-of-new-trial&quot;&gt;finished the first cycle&lt;/a&gt; of a new clinical trial that he says went well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m nearly through my first cycle of the new clinical trial and overall I think it’s gone pretty well. I was able to get the 6 pills/day (3 in the morning, 3 in the evening) without too much concern. That said, by the end of the 5 days taking the pills I would basically sleep for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same day, he published what would be his &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2015/08/24/rememberances&quot;&gt;final request&lt;/a&gt; to the WordPress community. King requested that anyone with memories of him and his career to submit them to his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things my wife and I are trying to do is put together some information about my career that will hopefully give my 6 year-old daughter a better sense of who I was as an adult. She knows me as “dad”, but when she gets older she’ll be curious about who I was to my peers and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any memories of King, please honor his request and &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/contact&quot;&gt;submit them&lt;/a&gt; to his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outpouring of Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the news of King&amp;#8217;s death spread throughout the community, many shared grief on Twitter while others reflected on his accomplishments in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Most &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&quot;&gt;#WordPress&lt;/a&gt; users will never know how important &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexkingorg&quot;&gt;@alexkingorg&lt;/a&gt; was to our CMS. A great loss to the community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JPtI3gMfE7&quot;&gt;https://t.co/JPtI3gMfE7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;King&amp;#8217;s Impact on WordPress Early On&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King is one of a handful of people who witnessed the transition &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Content/Part%201/2-b2-cafelog.md&quot;&gt;from b2 to WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. He&amp;#8217;s one of the earliest WordPress developers and is largely credited with motivating developers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Content/Part%203/12-themes.md&quot;&gt;build themes&lt;/a&gt; using the template engine in WordPress 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex King wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/20/wordpress-css-style-switcher&quot;&gt;CSS Style Switcher&lt;/a&gt; hack, which came with three CSS stylesheets. Not everyone who had a WordPress blog wanted to create their own stylesheet, and many didn’t know how. Users needed a pool of stylesheets to choose from. To grow the number of stylesheets available, Alex ran a WordPress &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2004/01/25/wordpress-css-style-competition&quot;&gt;CSS Style competition&lt;/a&gt;. Prizes, donated by members of the community, were offered for the top three stylesheets; $70, $35, and $10 respectively. &amp;#8211; WordPress History Book&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first contest, King received 38 submissions with Pink Lillies by Naoko Takano winning first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pink-lillies.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-48383&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/pink-lillies.png?resize=500%2C300&quot; alt=&quot;Pink Lillies Wins First Design Contest&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pink Lillies Wins First Design Contest
&lt;p&gt;Each sylesheet submitted to the contest was &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/styles&quot;&gt;available to the public&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, King&amp;#8217;s website was an early version of the WordPress theme directory. In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2005/02/27/wordpress-theme-competition&quot;&gt;second contest&lt;/a&gt;, he received over 100 submissions. In total, King hosted 138 themes on his site. He decided not to host the competition again in 2006 due to the sheer amount of work required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appearances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King appeared on several different WordPress podcasts and spoke at a number of WordCamps. Here are links to a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-79-%e2%80%93-alex-king-and-wphelpcenter&quot;&gt;WPWeekly Episode 79 – Alex King And WPHelpCenter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Memorable Experience With Alex King&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I spoke to King in person was at WordCamp San Francisco 2013. A group of us rode together in a party limo complete with blinking lights inside. I sat across from him and asked a few questions related to his health. I also asked him about the early days of WordPress. King was a soft-spoken man who at times is hard to hear but it turned out to be a great and memorable conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WordPress community has lost an inspirational person and a pillar of the WordPress project. My deepest condolences go out to his friends and family. King is survived by his wife Heather and his daughter Caitlin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: Rest in peace, Alex King</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14479</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/alex-king/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The prototypical WordPress developer and blogger, Alex King was a tremendously influential member of the WordPress ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was one of a very small group of people involved during the transition of b2 to WordPress. He helped to create the website that would become the first WordPress.com VIP client. He started the first WordPress-centric consulting agency. He was fundamental to the development and direction of dozens of WordPress features. He even created a small icon that would go on to become the ubiquitous &amp;#8220;share icon&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex was a selfless contributor, a driven entrepreneur, and a friend to many. He was also a husband to Heather and a father to Caitlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to web work, Alex loved golf and photography. His blog is an outstanding example of the art, where he logged his story, his passions, and his challenges. I could not possibly tell his story better &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/about&quot;&gt;than he himself can&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following are more valuable links to help remember Alex:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is a sad day for the WordPress community, and Alex King will be missed. May he rest in peace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress 4.4 to Possibly Rearrange Fields to the Comment Form</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48365</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-4-to-possibly-rearrange-fields-to-the-comment-form</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress plugin and theme developers need to take note of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/25/changes-to-fields-output-by-comment_form-in-wordpress-4-4/&quot;&gt;important change in WordPress 4.4&lt;/a&gt; that rearranges the comment form. In WordPress 4.4, the comment form is arranged so that the text area is displayed first followed by the name, email, and website fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentsFirst.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48366&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentsFirst.png?resize=1024%2C992&quot; alt=&quot;Comment Text Area is First&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Comment Text Area is First
&lt;p&gt;According to Aaron Jorbin, WordPress core developer, the change improves navigation when using the keyboard to toggle through fields. It also makes it easier for users to leave comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the change requires filters and actions to run in a different order, the HTML output by &lt;code&gt;comment_form&lt;/code&gt; will be different. Jorbin explains that if developers use any of the hooks inside &lt;code&gt;comment_form&lt;/code&gt;, especially &lt;code&gt;comment_form_field_comment&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;comment_form_after_fields&lt;/code&gt;, developers should test their themes and plugins using &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/download/nightly/&quot;&gt;WordPress 4.4 nightlies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run into any problems or inconsistencies, please report them to&lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29974&quot;&gt; ticket #29974&lt;/a&gt;. What do you think of the change? Do you think readers want to write their comment first instead of filling out the other three fields?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordCampus Renames Event to WPCampus</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48351</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wordcampus-renames-event-to-wpcampus</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WPCampusFeaturedImage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48353&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WPCampusFeaturedImage.png?resize=811%2C161&quot; alt=&quot;WPCampus Featured Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordcampus-a-conference-devoted-to-using-wordpress-in-higher-education&quot;&gt;WordCampus was announced&lt;/a&gt;, some of our readers &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordcampus-a-conference-devoted-to-using-wordpress-in-higher-education#comment-72098&quot;&gt;expressed concern&lt;/a&gt; that the event&amp;#8217;s name is too similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/&quot;&gt;WordCamp US&lt;/a&gt; and would cause confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also concern that without being officially sanctioned by WordCamp Central, the event would infringe the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/&quot;&gt;WordCamp trademark&lt;/a&gt; that is owned and protected by the WordPress Foundation. To alleviate these concerns, the organizing group changed the name from WordCampus to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;WPCampus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachel Carden, one of the event&amp;#8217;s primary organizers, says the team had a backup plan from day one, &amp;#8220;While most of the community agreed that the name WordCampus was spot on, the possibility of changing our name was proposed from day one as WordCampus was being confused with WordCamp US,&amp;#8221; Carden said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As much as we love WordCampus, we didn’t want it to get in the way of what we hope to achieve, so the topic was passionately discussed at a planning meeting. The entire community cast their votes for a new name and WPCampus was selected as the clear winner,&amp;#8221; Carden told the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 250 people have expressed interest in WPCampus. If you’re interested in speaking, sponsoring, or attending the event, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;fill out the survey. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Cars should be Open Source</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45365</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/09/cars-should-be-open-source/</link>
	<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reality is that more and more decisions, including decisions about life and death, are being made by software,” Thomas Dullien, a well-known security researcher and reverse engineer who goes by the Twitter handle Halvar Flake, said in an email. “But for the vast majority of software you interact with, you are not allowed to examine how it functions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/business/complex-car-software-becomes-the-weak-spot-under-the-hood.html&quot;&gt;has a great look at hacker and car manufacturer mishaps and makes the case over and over again for Open Source&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s great to see more of the world waking up to the importance of open source.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Freenode to Purge Inactive Nicks, Channels, and Accounts on October 2nd</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48346</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/freenode-to-purge-inactive-nicks-channels-and-accounts-on-october-2nd</link>
	<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cleaning.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-16322&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cleaning.jpg?resize=1025%2C491&quot; alt=&quot;photo credit: 13Moya 十三磨牙 - cc&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;photo credit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ericqian/4447132325/&quot;&gt;13Moya 十三磨牙&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://freenode.net/&quot;&gt;Freenode&lt;/a&gt;, the IRC network responsible for hosting communication servers for WordPress and many other open source projects &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.freenode.net/2015/09/services-database-purge/&quot;&gt;will be performing maintenance&lt;/a&gt; on or around October 2nd. Freenode will remove expired nicks, channels, and accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a lot of people have switched to &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;SlackHQ&lt;/a&gt; from IRC to communicate in real-time, the WordPress support channel with hundreds of users still exists on Freenode with no plans to move it to Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a registered account on Freenode and have not identified with the service in 120 days or more, you must authenticate your account before October 2nd. You can do this by connecting to Freenode and using the &lt;em&gt;/msg nickserv identify&lt;/em&gt; command, then enter your password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve forgotten your password, use the &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;verbatim-b&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://freenode.net/faq.shtml&quot;&gt;/msg nickserv sendpass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; command to recover lost passwords. Alternatively, use the &lt;em&gt;/msg nickserv help sendpass&lt;/em&gt; command to receive help recovering your password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s especially important for users who have registered channels on Freenode to authenticate or else the username and channels associated with it will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Donncha: WP Super Cache 1.4.5</title>
	<guid>http://z9.io/?p=89499667</guid>
	<link>http://z9.io/2015/09/25/wp-super-cache-1-4-5/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/&quot;&gt;WP Super Cache&lt;/a&gt; is a fast caching plugin for WordPress. It will help your site run faster and serve more traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a security and bugfix release.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some servers display a directory index when no index.html is found in a directory. That may reveal the filenames of cache files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There were issues in the settings page that might allow an attacker to browse or delete files named index.html.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; PHP Object Injection could occur if an attacker managed to inject malicious code into the legacy cache meta files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you upgrade, your “legacy cache” files for logged in users will be deleted. This may have an impact on your site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your site is slow at generating new pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have many known users (logged in users or people who comment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your site will suddenly have to generate new cache files for all visiting known users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on caching like this is not recommended for these types of users as it’s very inefficient. Each user has a separate cache file that must be checked whenever the plugin does administration work like cleaning up stale cache files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If most of your traffic is anonymous users who don’t comment you don’t need to worry about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Directory Listings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a server is configured to show directory listings it will show files and directories in the cache directory to visitors who access those directories directly through their browser. This might reveal private posts, and in the case where legacy caching is enabled for known users the login cookie was stored in &amp;#8220;.meta&amp;#8221; files that could be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-11-at-14.40.00.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-11-at-14.40.00.png?resize=660%2C275&quot; alt=&quot;2013&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-89499673&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files named &amp;#8220;index.html&amp;#8221; were added to the main cache directories to stop remote users viewing the contents of the cache directories. Unfortunately it&amp;#8217;s not possible to add empty index.html files to the supercache directories because those files could be served by accident to legitimate visitors of the site. However, the plugin will also add a directive that disables directory listings to the file cache/.htaccess. You can now also change the location of the cache directory on the Advanced Settings page of the plugin. If you can&amp;#8217;t disable directory indexing on your server and you have private posts you should change this location and use PHP mode to serve cache files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/cache-location.png?resize=660%2C314&quot; alt=&quot;cache-location&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-89499679&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a directory index is found in the cache directory it will show a warning like this to administrators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-12.27.29.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/z9.io/files/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-12-at-12.27.29.png?resize=660%2C231&quot; alt=&quot;index.html warnings&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-89499671&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking the logout link will log everyone out, except the user who clicks it, but it guarantees that the login cookies are updated, just in case someone has copied the cookie from an old meta file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Directory Traversal and File Deletion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User input in the settings page wasn&amp;#8217;t properly sanitised. The code that sanitised directory paths when deleting cache files wasn&amp;#8217;t secure and might allow an attacker to view or delete files named index.html. Deletes are protected by a nonce, limiting the useful lifetime of the URL however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PHP Object Injection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin used serialize and unserialize &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/topic/php-object-injection?replies=2&quot;&gt;to store data&lt;/a&gt; in &amp;#8220;legacy cache&amp;#8221; meta files. This might be used to perform a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection&quot;&gt;PHP object injection&lt;/a&gt; attack. Serialised data is now stored as JSON data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of legacy cached files has changed. The files in the meta directory no longer have a .meta extension. They are .php files now and each file has a &amp;#8220;die()&amp;#8221; command to stop anyone loading them.&lt;br /&gt;
The data stored in those files is now stored as JSON serialised data. The login cookie is an MD5 hash now as well.&lt;br /&gt;
When you upgrade the plugin your existing legacy cache files will be deleted and regenerated as visitors use your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from those security fixes there have been a number of enhancements and bugfixes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Disabling the plugin no longer deletes the configuration file. Uninstalling will do that however.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Enhancement: Only preload public post types. Props webaware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; It&amp;#8217;s now possible to deactivate the plugin without visiting the settings page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Fixed the cache rebuild system. Rebuild files were deleted immediately but now survive up to 10 seconds longer than the request that generate them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Minor optimisations: prune_super_cache() exits immediately if the file doesn&amp;#8217;t exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The output of wp_cache_get_cookies_values() is now cached per visit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Added PHP pid to the debug log to aid debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Various small bug fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Fixed reset of expiry time and GC settings when updating advanced settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Removed CacheMeta class to avoid APC errors. It&amp;#8217;s not used any more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Fixed reset of advanced settings when using &amp;#8220;easy&amp;#8221; settings page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release wouldn&amp;#8217;t be possible without the help of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kraft.im/&quot;&gt;Brandon Kraft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dane&quot;&gt;Dane Odekirk&lt;/a&gt;, Ben Bidner, Jouko Pynnönen and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrutinizer-ci.com/&quot;&gt;Scrutinizer&lt;/a&gt;.

	<title>WPTavern: Lessons I Learned Moderating Comments in WordPress</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48340</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/lessons-i-learned-moderating-comments-in-wordpress</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In the past 4-5 weeks, I&amp;#8217;ve moderated every comment submitted to WP Tavern. Not only was it an experiment to see what would happen but a new way for me to use WordPress. The experiment introduced me to several drawbacks in WordPress&amp;#8217; comment moderation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lack of Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments that are pending moderation in the WordPress backend that are in response to another comment are hard to moderate. Take the following screenshot for example. This comment is in response to a comment submitted by Norcross. Unless I open Norcross&amp;#8217; comment in a new browser tab or window, I have no idea what the context of the conversation is. Pending notifications in the WordPress mobile app also don&amp;#8217;t show text from the parent comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48150&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png?resize=851%2C161&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area
&lt;p&gt;I propose that WordPress core adds the text from parent comments to replies in the backend so I know what people are responding too. This also helps when replying to comments from the backend as I&amp;#8217;ll know the context of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lack of Notifications That a Comment in Moderation is Approved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress does not send an email notification when a comment is approved from moderation. However, there are a lot of people &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717&quot;&gt;working to add&lt;/a&gt; this feature to WordPress 4.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Whitelisting System for Anonymous Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest drawback to comment moderation is that not every comment needs to be moderated. A whitelisting system can lessen the burden of having to moderate each comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress provides the ability to blacklist comments. You can also configure a set of parameters to determine when a comment goes into the moderation queue such as, number of links, content within the comment, and if the comment author has a previously approved comment. None of these configurations are useful if WordPress is configured to send every comment to moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WP Tavern does not have open registration and allows comments from anonymous people. This makes whitelisting difficult since the IP address, name, URL, and email address of a commenter can easily change or be imitated. The whitelisting component of WordPress becomes more useful if you can tie it to a registered user account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m unsure if WordPress can improve this area of the moderation system or if it&amp;#8217;s an assumed risk administrators take when accepting anonymous comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Major Time Suck&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderating every comment is a pain and sucks up time that can be spent doing something else. During my vacation last week, I continued to moderate comments from the WordPress mobile app because if I didn&amp;#8217;t, the conversation stopped. I&amp;#8217;ve concluded that by accepting anonymous comments, there needs to be a way for the audience to help moderate instead of doing it on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a future post, I&amp;#8217;m going to list a few WordPress plugins I&amp;#8217;ve discovered that takes the commenting system to the next level. Many of the plugins solve one or most of the problems listed above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WP Super Cache 1.4.5 Patches XSS Vulnerability</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48336</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wp-super-cache-1-4-5-patches-xss-vulnerability</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you use &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/&quot;&gt;WP Super Cache&lt;/a&gt;, you should immediately update to version 1.4.5 as it &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/changelog/&quot;&gt;patches a XSS vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; in the settings page. This version also prevents PHP object injections. In addition to security patches, 1.4.5 contains a number of bug fixes. Make sure to update your sites as soon as possible to patch the vulnerability. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://z9.io/2015/09/25/wp-super-cache-1-4-5/&quot;&gt;find more details&lt;/a&gt; on this release on Donncha Ó Caoimh&amp;#8217;s website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: All about the WordPress REST API and its current state — Draft podcast</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14463</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/the-wordpress-rest-api-draft-podcast/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Post Status Draft podcast, which you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008&quot;&gt;on iTunes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss&quot;&gt;via RSS&lt;/a&gt; for your favorite podcatcher. Brian and his co-host, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle&quot;&gt;Joe Hoyle&lt;/a&gt;, a co-founder and the CTO of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hmn.md/&quot;&gt;Human Made&lt;/a&gt;, discuss some of today’s hottest, current WordPress news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, Joe and Brian go into depth discussing all aspects of the WordPress REST API, and the state of the API today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the recent merge proposal, there is a good chance it will be included in WordPress core via a two stage process in the WordPress 4.4 and 4.5 releases. The first release would be the core infrastructure and the second release would include the endpoints. This is our longest podcast, but we go in depth on one of WordPress&amp;#8217;s most anticipated features in years.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Akismet: Akismet WordPress Plugin 3.1.4</title>
	<guid>http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1873</guid>
	<link>http://blog.akismet.com/2015/09/24/akismet-3-1-4-wordpress/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Version 3.1.4 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the Akismet plugin for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; is now available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update clarifies the error messages that Akismet uses so that they&amp;#8217;re easier to understand, and it enables link previews in the admin for all links in a comment &amp;#8212; not just the author&amp;#8217;s website link. A fix is also included for a bug that could have caused comment moderation emails to be sent for some comments that were caught as spam.  For a full list of the changes in this release, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/log/akismet/trunk&quot;&gt;revision log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions. If you need to download the plugin zip file directly, links to all versions are available in &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/&quot;&gt;the WordPress plugins directory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/1873/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&amp;blog=116920&amp;post=1873&amp;subd=akismet&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-3-billie-named-after-jazz-singer-billie-holiday-is-available-for-download&quot;&gt;features in WordPress 4.3&lt;/a&gt; is that comments on pages are disabled by default. If you only enable comments for posts, you may be interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;WP Comment Humility&lt;/a&gt;, a new plugin created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;John James Jacoby&lt;/a&gt; that moves the top-level Comments menu item to the Posts menu. The following screenshot better illustrates what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48314&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentHumilityInAction.png?resize=429%2C378&quot; alt=&quot;Comment Humility in Action&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Comment Humility in Action
&lt;p&gt;If a site enables comments for posts only, this location for the menu item makes sense. What if you&amp;#8217;re using Custom Post Types? According the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/faq/&quot;&gt;plugin&amp;#8217;s FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, the user experience might be weird, &amp;#8220;If you have a post type other than &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; that supports comments, it may make more sense to not use this plugin,&amp;#8221; Jacoby said. He suggests giving it a try and if the user experience doesn&amp;#8217;t feel right, to disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/stuttter/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;located on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; where you can also submit Pull Requests. WP Comment Humility works out-of-the-box without any configuration options on WordPress 4.3 and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-comment-humility/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; in the WordPress plugin directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Highlights From Matt Mullenweg’s Q&amp;A Session on Product Hunt</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48303</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/highlights-from-matt-mullenwegs-qa-session-on-product-hunt</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;On September 22nd, Matt Mullenweg participated in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;question and answer session&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. Product Hunt is a site &lt;span class=&quot;_Tgc&quot;&gt;that lets users share and discover new products. In the session, Mullenweg answers questions like what advice he&amp;#8217;d give to his 20 and 25-year-old self and how he combats burn out. Here are a few highlights from the session.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nikhil V&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Hello Matt, with the upcoming release of the WP REST API in WordPress core, what do you hope to most see built with its capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m hugely excited about the REST API! Once the infrastructure is in, I think we&amp;#8217;ll see really widespread adoption from plugins that right now are creating their endpoints in very ad-hoc ways. Once we iterate a bit more on the core content endpoints and authentication I think we&amp;#8217;ll see a lot more specialized interfaces built on WP as like a content kernel, an engine powering a wide array of applications and interfaces you&amp;#8217;d never imagine having WordPress behind them today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erik Torenberg &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;If you could go back in time and give advice for your, say, 20-year-old self, what would you tell yourself? How about 25?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; To my 20-year-old self I would say to be okay with things building up over time. Something I didn&amp;#8217;t appreciate until recently is that there any many productive decades ahead with which to build the things that I feel need to exist in the world. One of the best things I did then was avoid any press or capitalization on my age (to the extent I could) because youth is an ephemeral asset and just a novelty in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my 25-year-old self I would tell him to slow down and think about health more, I burned the candle at both ends that year. I would also say to not get as caught up in mailing list and IRC arguments and discussions, just focus on building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sydney Liu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In the early days of WordPress, what was the 20% that got you the 80% of the results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; There&amp;#8217;s no simple answer there, if I had to pick one thing it would be &lt;em&gt;luck&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Kristof Bernaert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; How do you see WP about 5 years, or how do you want it to see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In 5 years I think that WP will be infinitely easier to use for both power-users, developers, and newbies. You will be able to have a full experience of core, plugins, themes, docs, and support in several dozen languages that will be as large or larger than English. There will be over a million people making their living on top of the platform. Most people will be creating from touch devices, and their content will mostly not come from keyboards (virtual or physical) as an input device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;Tys Bradford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comments--item--heading--name&quot;&gt;&amp;#8211; Your accomplishments with WordPress have literally changed the face of the internet and enabled people without programming skills to make beautiful and functional websites. Do you think this could be replicated ever with mobile applications (iOS/Android)? I have seen a few companies try, but none have come close to delivering in the way WordPress is able to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Mullenweg&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Thank you! The ecosystems and app stores for iOS and Android right now are too locked down, and the discoverability and overhead of apps is too distorted, for an approach like WordPress&amp;#8217; to work for mobile applications. The environment for the foreseeable future there is going to favor more centralized apps, my only hope is that at least a few get really successful (including ours) that aren&amp;#8217;t advertising-driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Question Was Not Answered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my question was not answered. However, I&amp;#8217;m going to ask it in this post with the hope that he&amp;#8217;ll answer it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve spent a lot of time, money, and energy trying to create a great mobile experience in WordPress via dedicated apps. As more of the WordPress backend becomes responsive, how will this affect (if any) the priority level of developing the mobile apps versus putting that time and effort into a 100% responsive WordPress backend?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mullenweg answers a lot more questions than what&amp;#8217;s listed above but those are the ones that stand out to me. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.producthunt.com/live/matt-mullenweg&quot;&gt;read the entire session&lt;/a&gt; on the Product Hunt site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WordPress REST API Is One Major Step Closer to Being Merged Into Core</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48284</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-rest-api-is-one-major-step-closer-to-being-merged-into-core</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;After more than three years of development, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://v2.wp-api.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress REST API&lt;/a&gt; is one major step closer to getting merged into core. Ryan McCue, a lead contributor to the project, published the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;official proposal&lt;/a&gt; to merge the API into WordPress. The proposal explains what the REST API is, why it&amp;#8217;s needed, an integration plan, and what happens after the merge. The plan is to integrate the API in two stages, infrastructure and endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Part Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure is the code responsible for routing requests and handling the meta layer of the API, including JSON serialization/deserialization, linking, embedding, and REST best practices. Merging the infrastructure first allows developers to start building upon it and to migrate from existing custom code. The plan is to merge the infrastructure portion of the API in WordPress 4.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endpoints are considered the more complex of the two as they’re responsible for mapping data from the external JSON format to the internal data structures and vice versa. In other words, endpoints are the bridges of communication between WordPress and external applications. To provide more time for core committers to review the code, endpoints will be merged in WordPress 4.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of the API &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API&quot;&gt;takes place on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; but core WordPress development takes place on Subversion and Trac. When the API is merged into core, it will no longer be developed as a separate project. McCue proposes that the best of GitHub and Trac be integrated so developers comfortable with GitHub can continue to contribute to the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the team’s experience with GitHub as well as Trac, we can bring the best of both worlds by helping integrate the two. This would also improve contributions to WordPress as a whole, and benefit the whole community. This will be especially important as we encourage more contributions from the wider community (client authors, for example). We think we can make good progress here, and we’d love to try to help improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress&quot;&gt;GitHub repository for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;s synced to its Subversion counterpart, it does not accept pull requests. If integrating GitHub and Trac proves to be successful, it could open the door for WordPress to accept pull requests or contributions through GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan to merge the API into core is not finalized and the team needs your &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/&quot;&gt;comments, questions, and opinions&lt;/a&gt;. I encourage you to read the full proposal and the comments as McCue answers additional questions related to the merge. How happy are you to see this merge proposal?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The Impacts HeroPress Is Having on WordPress Communities in India</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48286</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-impacts-heropress-is-having-on-wordpress-communities-in-india</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Topher DeRosia, who recently attended&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia&quot;&gt; WordCamp Pune&lt;/a&gt;, India, &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/subtle-impacts/&quot;&gt;published a post on the HeroPress blog&lt;/a&gt; that describes the subtle impacts the project is having on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saurabh Shukla, lead organizer for WordCamp Pune, says the site inspired not only their speaker selection but their presentations as well, &amp;#8220;We wanted people to derive at least a level of inspiration from the speakers and decided that stories make more sense than presentations,&amp;#8221; Shukla said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of inspiring presentations at WordCamp Pune include, a workshop where people could experience accessibility issues for themselves, WordPress for activism, and building education products for South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Presentation in a Classroom at WordCamp Pune
&lt;p&gt;According to DeRosia, many Indians feel like their WordPress communities are not getting the respect they deserve. DeRosia believes the amount of excitement expressed by Indians for HeroPress is because their work is noticed and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;That&lt;/em&gt; is why India is excited about HeroPress. They’re getting respect. Not just from me, but from thousands of readers around the world,&amp;#8221; DeRosia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although DeRosia says he&amp;#8217;d be content with the impacts the site has had if HeroPress ended today, I would be sad to see it go  because it&amp;#8217;s a great addition to the WordPress community. Thankfully, DeRosia says people are requesting more essays, exchanges of knowledge, shared wisdom, shared respect, and more of the HeroPress spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an essay published on HeroPress or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;project&amp;#8217;s mission&lt;/a&gt; has inspired you in any way, please let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Interview, and Complementing Slack</title>
	<guid>http://ma.tt/?p=45326</guid>
	<link>http://ma.tt/2015/09/complementing-slack/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.me/tonyconrad&quot;&gt;Tony Conrad&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strictlyvc.com/&quot;&gt;StrictlyVC&lt;/a&gt; event in San Francisco last week, following a dizzyingly talented line-up of &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/chamath-palihapitaya-on-insane-burn-rates-ipos-and-raising-a-new-real-estate-fund/&quot;&gt;Chamath Palihapitiya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dfj.com/content/steve-jurvetson&quot;&gt;Steve Jurvetson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/18/move-over-slack-automattic-mulls-commercializing-its-own-internal-messaging-product/&quot;&gt;Techcrunch has a good write-up with a number of the relevant quotes from the event&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing I&amp;#8217;d like to respond to, because it wasn&amp;#8217;t a direct quote, is the headline &amp;#8220;Move Over Slack? Automattic Mulls Commercializing Its Own Internal Messaging Product.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem is the headline missed the obvious alliteration of &amp;#8220;Mullenweg Mulls,&amp;#8221; &lt;img src=&quot;http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f600.png&quot; alt=&quot;😀&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;but more importantly&amp;#8230; &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; has become a really key tool for both Automattic &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/chat/&quot;&gt;and WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt; and anything we do with the evolution of &lt;a href=&quot;http://p2theme.com/&quot;&gt;P2&lt;/a&gt; (some of which we already have running internally) will be complementary to Slack, not competitive with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jeff Yablon and the WordPress Foundation Settle Out of Court</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48267</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jeff-yablon-and-the-wordpress-foundation-settle-out-of-court</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;WordPress Foundation sued Jeff Yablon&lt;/a&gt; for trademark infringement. The Foundation wanted Yablon to stop using its trademarks, dismiss the opposition proceeding, pay the foundation for any profits related to use of the WordPress trademarks, pay up to $100,000 per infringing domain name, transfer the domains and pay other fees and damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline of Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 22nd, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=7&quot;&gt;Yablon filed a request&lt;/a&gt; for default judgement. On June 29th, the Foundation responded to Yablon by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=8&quot;&gt;asking the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board&lt;/a&gt; to deny Yablon&amp;#8217;s request for default judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 9th, David Mermelstein, Administrative Trademark Judge, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=9&quot;&gt;filed a response&lt;/a&gt; that not only denied Yablon&amp;#8217;s motion for default judgment, but also suspended proceedings until the civil case was complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With proceedings suspended, Yablon could no longer file motions or requests with the TTAB. The only option left was to proceed through court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Settlement Between Yablon and The Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 21st, Yablon and the WordPress Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudup.com/cLmq3DWS6MZ&quot;&gt;settled out of court&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48277&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/YablonSettlementSample.png?resize=839%2C621&quot; alt=&quot;Sample of Settlement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sample of Settlement
&lt;h3&gt;Yablon&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the settlement, by no later than October 15th, Yablon agrees to cease any and all use of the WordPress name, logos, trademarks, and any other name or mark confusingly similar to the term WordPress or its logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also has to cease any and all use of the WordPress Marks, standing alone or in combination with other words or designs, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use in any company name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta-tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domain names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personalized URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyword Advertising on Yablon&amp;#8217;s websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media handles or account names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indoor outdoor store signage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letterhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stationary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon must also comply with the terms of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/&quot;&gt;WordPress trademark and domain name policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No later than five days after the effective date (Oct 15th), Yablon has to transfer all of the domains he owns that incorporate the WordPress Mark to the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Yablon acknowledges that the Foundation owns and has the exclusive rights in and to the WordPress marks in connection with the goods and services identified in each of WordPress&amp;#8217; registrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yablon can no longer do anything inconsistent with the Foundation&amp;#8217;s ownership of its WordPress Marks and registrations thereof, including but not limited to, contesting the Foundation&amp;#8217;s title to or the validity of the WordPress marks or the trademark registrations thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WordPress Foundation&amp;#8217;s Obligations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Yablon transfers the domains to the Foundation and does not breach the terms of the agreement, the Foundation will redirect the domains to a domain of Yablon&amp;#8217;s choosing for 6 months from the effective date or April 1, 2016, whichever comes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 10 days of the domains being transferred, the Foundation will file a stipulated request to withdrawal its U.S. Opposition Proceeding No. 91221895 without prejudice and Case 3:15-cv02745 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, without prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as Yablon does not breach the agreement, the Foundation agrees not to sue for violating its trademarks prior to the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foundation will not object to Yablon&amp;#8217;s use of the WordPress Marks as part of any subdomains or subdirectories associated with any second level domain name registered to and controlled exclusively by Yablon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples include but are not limited to, wordpress.answerguy.com or answerguy.com/wordpress in connection with services that involve use of the WordPress platform, support the WordPress brand services, and that do not otherwise violate the rights of the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parties agree to bear their own attorney&amp;#8217;s fees and costs, if any were incurred through the effective date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-sues-jeff-yablon-for-trademark-infringement&quot;&gt;spoke to Yablon&lt;/a&gt; on the phone in June shortly after the lawsuit was filed, he sounded like he knew what he was getting into and the complexities involved with U.S. Trademarks. Yablon strongly believed he had enough evidence to pursue the matter and to see it through the court system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing the court case all the way through, he chose to give up which in the court system, is not the same thing as losing, as losing or winning sets a precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Yablon didn&amp;#8217;t lose the case, the WordPress Foundation didn&amp;#8217;t win either. It&amp;#8217;s a reminder that the Foundation will aggressively defend its trademarks in the court system if other means prove unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think Yablon’s mission to defend his use of WordPress in a top-level domain name and potentially open the door for others to do the same, was in the best interest of the WordPress community as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: Gravity Flow makes custom form administrative workflows simple</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14337</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/gravity-flow-makes-custom-form-administrative-workflows-simple/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;Gravity Flow&lt;/a&gt; is one of the coolest new plugins I&amp;#8217;ve seen in quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoices, purchase orders, job applications, and employee vacation requests are just a few potential applications for Gravity Flow, which makes form-centric approval, user input, and notification processes simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With Gravity Flow, you use the power of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; to design your forms, and you use Gravity Flow to design your process using easy to use drag-and-drop tools,&amp;#8221; the video states. The flows created in Gravity Flow can be customized to include all sorts of user-defined paths to request stakeholder feedback, get administrative approval, or fire off a notification that a certain step in the flow has been accomplished. It can even be integrated with other notification systems like Zapier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that common to see a WordPress plugin (especially an add-on plugin) that simultaneously targets a niche and serves it so extensively. Gravity Flow is built to extend the powerful Gravity Forms product, and it really takes it an extra mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of potential for Gravity Flow for intranets and other corporate environments with lots of stakeholders and traditionally clunky, email based workflows for approval of common tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trying Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took Gravity Flow for a spin, because there is a handy demo site capability built in. For a plugin this complex, being able to test drive it is a really great feature. Most workflow tasks can take place either in the admin or on the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating workflows feels a lot like adding regular notifications to Gravity Forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14340&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-workflow-752x579.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workflows have many configuration and sending options. And each step can be sorted and arranged to follow a series of steps, and can even allow for delays (like for a scholarship review period, in my example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s the view for an administrator, but someone who is responsible for providing feedback or approval has a front-end view to directly interact with the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14339&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-review-update-workflow-752x872.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-review-update-workflow&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;872&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And administrators can see reports of activity for various workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14338&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/gravity-flow-reports-752x552.png&quot; alt=&quot;gravity-flow-reports&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;552&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty simple overview of the plugin, and I&amp;#8217;d recommend you &lt;a href=&quot;http://demo.gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the demo&lt;/a&gt;, or his full &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.gravityflow.io/category/34-walkthroughs&quot;&gt;walkthrough&lt;/a&gt; examples. but this at least highlights some of the plugin&amp;#8217;s power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Development of Gravity Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting things about Gravity Flow is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/&quot;&gt;Steven Henty&lt;/a&gt; made it. Steven actually works at Rocketgenius, the company behind Gravity Forms, and he is a developer of the main Gravity Forms product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to Steven about why this isn&amp;#8217;t a Gravity Forms official add-on, and what it&amp;#8217;s like working on a side project for your own company&amp;#8217;s product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocketgenius has a lot of plans and loads of really exciting stuff in the pipeline so it was a question of priorities &amp;#8211; Rocketgenius can’t possibly do absolutely everything at the same time. For me it’s a project that’s niche enough to be an interesting and profitable side project and yet not too time-consuming so I can continue to focus 100% on my day job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also reiterated how important it is to him that he had his team behind him for this project. And Carl Hancock &amp;#8212; co-founder of Rocketgenius &amp;#8212; is excited about Steven&amp;#8217;s product as well, saying &amp;#8220;The product is awesome. It&amp;#8217;s definitely more complex [and] business oriented, but that&amp;#8217;s a good thing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl also shared that Steve has a background that lends itself to thinking about complex problems to solve, working on, &amp;#8220;more enterprise stuff pre-WordPress, on a wide variety of platforms and programming languages.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve did a great job with Gravity Flow, and I&amp;#8217;m happy to see it out there.  On &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stevenhenty.com/gravity-flow/&quot;&gt;his personal blog&lt;/a&gt;, he highlights use cases for the product, which are real world examples based on how his first 100 beta testers are using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gravity ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Rocketgenius employees have Gravity Forms focused side projects, which I think is really cool. Another favorite of mine is David Smith&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://gravitywiz.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Wiz&lt;/a&gt;, that adds functionality snippets, or &amp;#8220;perks&amp;#8221;, to Gravity Forms. The third-party ecosystem is doing well too; &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityplus.pro/&quot;&gt;Gravity Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityview.co/&quot;&gt;Gravity View&lt;/a&gt; are two healthy Gravity Forms focused businesses that come to mind, and I&amp;#8217;m sure there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main plugin continues to dominate the WordPress forms space. Though it is commercial only, it powers hundreds of thousands of websites, and has dozens of official &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/&quot;&gt;add-ons&lt;/a&gt;. Carl has told me many times he doesn&amp;#8217;t even view most other WordPress forms plugins as competition (though newer entrants like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ninjaforms.com/&quot;&gt;Ninja Forms&lt;/a&gt; are doing quite well for themselves), as Gravity Forms aims to take marketshare away from complex hosted solutions like Wufoo, rather than gobble up the much larger but less demanding market that just wants simple contact forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep up with Gravity Flow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravityflow.io/&quot;&gt;check out the website&lt;/a&gt;. And the project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stevehenty/gravityflow&quot;&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt; as well, as Steve is billing for support and automatic upgrades, which starts at €87 (around $100) per year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems like the longest days are those in between an Apple announcement and when the products are actually available. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to iOS 9, WatchOS 2, 6s+, Apple TV&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Recap of WordCamp Pune, India, by Topher DeRosia</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48212</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia</link>
	<description>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-48213&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/TopherDeRosia.png?resize=150%2C150&quot; alt=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post was contributed by &lt;a title=&quot;Topher DeRosia&quot; href=&quot;http://topher1kenobe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Topher DeRosia&lt;/a&gt;. Topher has contributed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe#content-plugins&quot;&gt;number of plugins&lt;/a&gt;, spoken at many WordCamps, and is the lead of documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://easydigitaldownloads.com/&quot;&gt;Easy Digital Downloads.&lt;/a&gt; He also operates &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/&quot;&gt;HeroPress.com&lt;/a&gt; on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last July, the lead organizer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pune.wordcamp.org/2015/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Pune, India &lt;/a&gt;asked if I would come and speak about HeroPress. This post isn&amp;#8217;t going to be about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/about/&quot;&gt;HeroPress&lt;/a&gt; nor about &lt;a href=&quot;http://heropress.com/category/wordcamp/pune/&quot;&gt;my adventures on the trip&lt;/a&gt;. No, this post is going to be about a WordCamp in a relatively large city in India, how it compares to American WordCamps, and some things that were experimented with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Similarities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, WordCamp Pune is exactly like every other WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve been to. The night before the event, there was a speaker dinner with excellent food and wonderful company. Registration was chaotic because WiFi was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone was happy and excited to be there, and it was very loud because everyone wanted to be part of a conversation. It had all the elements I love about WordCamps; handshakes between new friends, hugs between old friends, and huge transfers of information between everyone, it was fantastic. Aside from WordCamp Miami, it&amp;#8217;s also the largest WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended with 500 tickets sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was well-organized, by which I mean things were well planned for, and handled well when they didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Sessions were held in university class rooms. I think they were a little small for the number of attendees, but it didn&amp;#8217;t detract from the experience. Here&amp;#8217;s an example of a room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48218&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordCamp-Pune-India-Classroom.png?resize=904%2C509&quot; alt=&quot;WordCamp Pune Classrooms&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s Ramya Pandyan talking about being a better blogger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first WordCamp I&amp;#8217;ve attended where the sessions were in a variety of languages. I would expect this in a place like WordCamp EU, but to have it be a variety of &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; languages was fascinating to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unofficial time zone of India is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2010/04/28/india-journal-understanding-ist-indian-stretchable-time/&quot;&gt;Indian Stretchable Time&lt;/a&gt;. On the first day of WordCamp, Saurabh worked hard to keep things on schedule. We started 30 minutes late, but on Foundation Day, things got started an hour late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was full of people sitting and waiting patiently, but starting on time was &lt;strong&gt;not expected&lt;/strong&gt;. In the US, I would have expected a lot more cranky people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things were heavily guarded. The main venue was quite open, but to get into Foundation Day, I had to let these guys check me with a magnetic wand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48219&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IndianPolicemen.png?resize=904%2C510&quot; alt=&quot;Indian Policemen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then 20 feet away sign in at a guard house, and then 30 feet beyond that show my ID inside the front door of the venue. This kind of thing also happened at restaurants and every time I went into my hotel. No-one was ever aggressive or suspicious, it&amp;#8217;s just something that happened and everyone took it in stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Word Lounge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48220&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordLounge.png?resize=298%2C462&quot; alt=&quot;Word Lounge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; There was a room set aside to be an all day open session for writers. There&amp;#8217;s a local group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlphabetSambar&quot;&gt;Alphabet Sambar&lt;/a&gt; (Sambar is a soup) that has a regular meetup to help each other with writing. They made sure to welcome attendees and keep a good discussion going all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this idea of unconference rooms based on topic. Some people thrive on the group communication that can come from that format, and I&amp;#8217;d love to see other topical open forums at other WordCamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The After Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of quiet after parties, so I can talk to people. I can also appreciate people wanting a pretty intense party atmosphere. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/crccpune&quot;&gt;Classic Rock Coffee Co.&lt;/a&gt; offered both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had three large areas, the largest being almost 6000 sq. ft., one about 800 sq. ft., and an ampitheater with seating for about 100 where they had live classic rock bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was a closed in area with seating for about 40 people that felt more like a cafe or restaurant. The larger open areas had a full bar and restaurant. Except for the cafe, the whole place had a fabric roof which is less sturdy than canvas. It had an outdoors feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at a table of about 15 people and had no trouble communicating with any of them. I was probably 130 feet from the music and it was well contained. I was able to communicate without noise being an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of people sat at tables, in the cafe, in the ampitheater; wherever they were most comfortable. It was probably my favorite after-party venue of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/a-recap-of-wordcamp-pune-india-by-topher-derosia#gallery-48212-1-slideshow&quot;&gt;Click to view slideshow.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bits and Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult thing for me was trying to discern people through their accents. Just about everyone had a solid handle on English, but there&amp;#8217;s a mental fatigue that comes from parsing the words through an accent. The longer you do it, the harder it gets, especially with sleep deprivation. I tried not to be rude, and people were patient with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a photo area with some crazy hats and people seemed to have a really good time with it. I can see it working at other WordCamps as well. The ladies from Hummingbird got one of me in a crazy hat, but I haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-48226&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CrazyHatPicture.png?resize=1025%2C578&quot; alt=&quot;Crazy Hat Picture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was prepared on-site in realtime and it worked. It was mostly sandwiches, and the food prep people took a request, made the sandwich, and handed it to the person in moments. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have expected it to work that smoothly, but it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit and bottled water were available just about all the time, which was nice since it was pretty hot that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the food and language, this WordCamp didn&amp;#8217;t feel all that foreign to me. I suspect it&amp;#8217;s because WordCamps have a solid template for sessions, scheduling, etc. I enjoyed that, it enabled me to really take part in the event without having to stand to the side wondering what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers seemed to be on the ball and did a great job sharing the responsibilities, which I think is vital with a camp this size. The people were engaged, took full advantage of the options available to them, and &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; is what made it a successful WordCamp in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever get the chance to attend a WordCamp in a culture other than your own, I highly recommend you jump at the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Look Inside the Offices of 16 People Who Work With WordPress on a Daily Basis</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48204</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-look-inside-the-offices-of-16-people-who-work-with-wordpress-on-a-daily-basis</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In a remote worker environment, people have the choice to work from home or wherever it&amp;#8217;s convenient. Syed Waseem Abbas published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://torquemag.io/inside-the-workplaces-of-16-wordpress-community-mavens/&quot;&gt;guest post on Torquemag,&lt;/a&gt; that looks at the offices of 16 people who work with WordPress on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the offices are classy while others are small. Many of the people featured in the post use one or more Apple products. If you&amp;#8217;re curious as to what my setup looks like, here you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48205&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JeffrosOffice.jpg?resize=960%2C720&quot; alt=&quot;My Home Office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My Home Office
&lt;p&gt;Most of the work I do is on a Windows 7 Professional 64bit desktop PC with two 23-inch monitors. When I work remotely, I use a fully loaded 15-inch MacBook Pro with retina display from 2013. As a devoted Windows user, I feel like I&amp;#8217;m part of a dying breed, especially within the WordPress ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For WordPress Weekly, I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Samson-CO1U-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000PTF0E2&quot;&gt;Samson CO1U&lt;/a&gt; USB powered condenser microphone connected to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/musical-instruments/dp/B001D7UYBO/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442008126&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Rode+Swivel+mount&quot;&gt;Rode PSA1 swivel mount&lt;/a&gt; with a boom arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predominantly work in a sitting position which is why I&amp;#8217;m in the market for a standing desk where the height can be easily adjusted. I&amp;#8217;m also looking for a new office chair where the arm rests don&amp;#8217;t disintegrate within the first year of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions, let me know in the comments. Also, if you need inspiration to create the perfect office environment, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://officetoday.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Office Today&lt;/a&gt;. Office Today features remote offices and locations from across the world used by Automattic employees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: bbPress 2015 Survey Results Show Users Want Attachments, Better Moderation Tools</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48180</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/bbpress-2015-survey-results-show-users-want-attachments-better-moderation-tools</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The bbPress development team &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2015/09/2015-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;published the results&lt;/a&gt; of its 2015 survey. This year, 213 people participated which is 30 more &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.org/blog/2014/05/2014-bbpress-survey-results/&quot;&gt;than last year&lt;/a&gt;. After reviewing, replacing, and removing some questions from the 2014 survey, this year&amp;#8217;s survey has 25 questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of survey question types were used to gather the data including, multiple choices, check boxes, text fields, email box, and open‐ended questions. Empty forms were deleted and those marked as incomplete were reviewed individually. Submissions that had no responses on the second and third pages of the survey were excluded from the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highlights From the Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of respondents use bbPress 2.5 and above with WordPress 4.2 and above. Seventy-one percent of participants using bbPress &amp;lt;=1.x.x are also using the latest version of WordPress. This data indicates bbPress users are vigilant in keeping their sites up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of who uses bbPress, 51% of respondents use it on their own sites while 30% create sites with bbPress forums for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48182&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015Users.png?resize=485%2C249&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress 2015 Survey Users&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress 2015 Survey Who Uses bbPress
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, the top three languages used are English 74%, German 7%, and French 6.5%. Three-fourths or 75% of bbPress installations are within WordPress either in the domain root, physical directory, or physical subdomain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining 25% are on multisite installations where more than half have activated bbPress network-wide and the rest in multiple networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48183&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015SurveyInstalls.jpg?resize=900%2C237&quot; alt=&quot;bbPress User Installations&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;bbPress User Installations
&lt;p&gt;One statistic I&amp;#8217;m proud of is that 29% of the respondents found out about the survey through WP Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48184&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015bbPressSurveyHowFoundOut.png?resize=854%2C328&quot; alt=&quot;How People Found Out About The Survey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The most wanted features in a bbPress theme are, Responsive (69.5%), Light and Fresh Design (52%), and Compatible with the latest bbPress version (49%). A preference for Responsive, mobile-first themes is in fourth place at 39%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second year in a row, Attachments (42.5%), Ajaxification of Topics and Replies (41.5%), and Moderation tools in the front end (39%) are the most requested features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48196&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bbPress2015MostRequestedFeatures.png?resize=463%2C219&quot; alt=&quot;2015 Most Requested Features&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2015 Most Requested Features
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of bbPress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercime, a BuddyPress and bbPress core contributor, confirmed at the end of the survey that the bbPress project is alive and well. According to Mercime, the development team is in the middle of a large migration project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://bbpress.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/src/humans.txt&quot;&gt;bbPress core team&lt;/a&gt; has been involved in the process of migrating the WordPress Support Forums (English and all Rosetta sites) from bbPress 1.x.x to bbPress 2.5.8 starting with one European-language forums subsite which has been already ported and being tested on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this migration has been discussed many times and often over the years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/&quot;&gt;@johnjamesjacoby&lt;/a&gt; formally started the process when he &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/05/15/wp-org-forums-plugins-audit/&quot;&gt;posted the results of an audit&lt;/a&gt; to show the custom functionality required for a successful migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involves multiple teams including, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/support/&quot;&gt;WP Support team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/&quot;&gt;WP Meta Team&lt;/a&gt;. The migration will impact more than 8 million users on WordPress.org. Any improvements made to bbPress to ease the migration process are going to be merged back into the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Confirms It Did Not Have a Security Breach</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48173</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/wpml-confirms-it-did-not-have-a-security-breach</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;When WPML emailed new &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/wpml-emails-passwords-to-affected-customers-in-plaintext&quot;&gt;passwords to customers in plaintext&lt;/a&gt;, some customers thought it was due to a security breach. Amit Kvint, compatibility team leader for WPML, confirmed the emails are not a result of a security breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/2015/09/password-update-email-from-wpml/&quot;&gt;post on the official WPML blog&lt;/a&gt;, Kvint says the emails were a preventive measure to insure accounts remain secure, &amp;#8220;The main purpose and underlying principle for this action was making sure everyone has a good new strong password, we consider this an important step in online security,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kvint acknowledges the improvements in WordPress 4.3 in how passwords are handled and admits that sending passwords in plaintext was not a good idea, &amp;#8220;The best practice would be, once the password is sent, to login and reset the password to a new strong one. We will definitely revise the way this is done in the future,&amp;#8221; Kvint said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog post does not go into detail in how they determined passwords to be weak. To the best of my knowledge, WPML does not have a policy in place to enforce strong passwords. While no accounts were compromised, if some of the contacted customers choose a weak password, wouldn&amp;#8217;t it defeat the purpose of resetting passwords in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Jetpack 3.7 Introduces a Simpler Interface, Adds Support for Development Sites</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48161</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-7-introduces-a-simpler-interface-adds-support-for-development-sites</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/2015/09/09/jetpack-3-7-simpler-ui-support-for-development-sites-and-more/&quot;&gt;is available&lt;/a&gt; and includes a simpler user interface, support for development sites, and fixes several issues with a variety of modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new interface separates some of Jetpack&amp;#8217;s functionality into categories such as, performance and security, traffic growth, and WordPress.com tools. The most commonly used modules are listed first with a link underneath that takes users to the other 27 modules and the old settings page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48162&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jetpack-37Interface.png?resize=968%2C492&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack 3.7 Interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack 3.7 Interface
&lt;p&gt;Turning a module on or off is accomplished by clicking a toggle. Services you need to pay for are clearly marked with links to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest drawbacks to Jetpack is switching between a local server or staging environment. If you move your site from one URL to another, Jetpack automatically detects the change and prompts the user to confirm if the URL is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48163&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite1.png?resize=1025%2C155&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack on a staging site&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack on a staging site
&lt;p&gt;If Jetpack thinks two URLs are separate websites, it recommends that you create a new connection to prevent a service interruption on the original domain. The prompt has links to reset the connection, confirm that the URL is part of a development environment, or submit a trouble ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48164&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/JetpackStagingSite2.png?resize=1025%2C143&quot; alt=&quot;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jetpack double checking to see if two URLs are separate sites
&lt;p&gt;The VideoPress player in Jetpack 3.7 works on mobile devices thanks to its responsive redesign. Having VideoPress enabled allows you to easily embed VideoPress powered videos to your site by copying and pasting the video&amp;#8217;s URL into the visual editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other changes included in 3.7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to enable per-post opt-out for Subscriptions by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetpack.me/support/subscriptions/#filters&quot;&gt;adding a filter&lt;/a&gt; to a functionality plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new Widget Visibility rule that allows you to show or hide widgets based on a page’s parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing buttons now display on bbPress forum posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jetpack 3.7 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/&quot;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; from the WordPress plugin directory. To view a list of all the changes in this release, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/changelog/&quot;&gt;check out the changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Conceptual WordPress Plugin by Stephen Cronin That Makes Comment Moderation Easier</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48149</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-conceptual-wordpress-plugin-by-stephen-cronin-that-makes-comment-moderation-easier</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Moderating replies to comments in the backend of WordPress is tough. For example, WordPress 4.3 displays the reply and who it&amp;#8217;s in response too, but doesn&amp;#8217;t show the text of the parent comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t see the parent comment unless you open the author link in a new browser tab. This is not an optimal user experience and makes it more difficult to determine if the reply is from a spammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48150&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WordPress43CommentContent.png?resize=851%2C161&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;WordPress 4.3 Comment Content Area
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;Show Parent Comment&lt;/a&gt; by Stephen Cronin, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch99.com/&quot;&gt;Scratch99 Design&lt;/a&gt;, is a potential solution to the problem. Simply activate and browse to the comment section of the WordPress backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show Parent Comment displays the text of the parent comment inside the reply. This helps moderators keep track of the conversation and helps to identify copy/paste spammers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48151&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ShowParentCommentPlugin.png?resize=847%2C223&quot; alt=&quot;Show Parent Comment Plugin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Easy Way to See The Parent Comment
&lt;p&gt;While the plugin works as advertised and shows the parent comment text, the interface needs to be improved. I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of the background color and some of the comment information is repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea is to replace the &lt;strong&gt;In Reply to Author&lt;/strong&gt; text to say, &lt;strong&gt;In Response To&lt;/strong&gt;. The show more or less button is a good idea but I think the text size needs to be increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Show Parent Comment is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/show-parent-comment/&quot;&gt;plugin directory for free&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s a proof of concept and is not officially supported by Cronin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept needs work but I think something similar needs to be added to WordPress core. As it stands, moderating comment replies is not a great experience and I think Cronin&amp;#8217;s plugin is a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WPML Emails Passwords to Affected Customers in Plaintext</title>

Matt Radford, a customer of WPML, kindly sent the Tavern a copy of the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Matt&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure that your WPML account remains secure. For this, we are updating all client accounts with auto-generated strong passwords. A strong password helps prevent unauthorized use of your WPML account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our system will start the password update shortly. We will send you another email with your new password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WPML team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radford received a follow-up email that includes his new password in plaintext. WPML explains why the passwords were sent in plaintext, &amp;#8220;We detected weak passwords in our system and following this we are enforcing, on a one-time procedure, strong passwords to all our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As for sending them in plaintext, if you consider it not to be safe, please update your password in order to keep it secure,&amp;#8221; WPML said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When questioned if passwords are stored in plaintext within the database, WPML replied, &amp;#8220;As for storing passwords in our database we are not storing it in plaintext, we are using standard WordPress. Yes they&amp;#8217;re salted and hashed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise VanDeCruze, a WPML support forum moderator, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/forums/topic/strange-email-from-wpml/#post-700143&quot;&gt;the email was generated automatically&lt;/a&gt; from their systems. She confirms that sending passwords in plaintext is not a best practice and urges users to login to their accounts and generate a new password using the reset password link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This email was automatically generated by our system and sent to clients with passwords that were deemed too simple. However, sending new passwords in plain text via email without requiring user action is not best practice. I urge you to change your WPML account password. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://wpml.org/account/account-settings/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were right to be cautious of this sudden email. Although it was not a phishing attempt, it was not the best way to ensure a safe password. In the future we will be mindful of adhering to strict security standards. Please let me know if you have any further questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WPML has not published any information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpml.org/blog/&quot;&gt;its blog&lt;/a&gt; that explains the situation and has yet to respond to our requests for comment. If you&amp;#8217;re a WPML customer and receive an email with a new password, you should immediately login and generate a new password using the site&amp;#8217;s reset password link and follow the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emailing passwords in plaintext is a terrible security practice. One of the key improvements in WordPress 4.3 is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/28/passwords-strong-by-default/&quot;&gt;WordPress no longer emails passwords&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it sends password reset links that expire after 24 hours. In hindsight, WPML should have generated and sent password reset emails to affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Help Me Add Comment Approval Notifications to WordPress</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48059</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/help-me-add-comment-approval-notifications-to-wordpress</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy&quot;&gt;enabling comment moderation&lt;/a&gt; on the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;ve discovered that WordPress does not notify commenters when their comments are approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Tavern, I&amp;#8217;m using the &lt;a title=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-approved/&quot;&gt;Comment Approved&lt;/a&gt; plugin by &lt;a title=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot; href=&quot;http://media-enzo.nl/&quot;&gt;Niels van Renselaar&lt;/a&gt;. It allows me to create a custom notification message that is sent when a comment is approved. Unfortunately, I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s working. Please let me know if you&amp;#8217;ve received any comment approval emails from the Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe this feature should be in core. I&amp;#8217;ve started the process by creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717&quot;&gt;feature request ticket&lt;/a&gt; on WordPress trac. Let&amp;#8217;s discuss the pros and cons or why you think it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be in core. Please give me your feedback in the comments or within the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: How Chris Klosowski’s Lifestyle Changed by Writing One WordPress Plugin</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48051</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/how-chris-klosowskis-lifestyle-changed-by-writing-one-wordpress-plugin</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Chris Klosowski, co-lead developer of Easy Digital Downloads, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kungfugrep.com/2015/09/how-writing-one-plugin-changed-my-lifestyle/&quot;&gt;explains how writing one plugin&lt;/a&gt; changed his lifestyle. He left his corporate job to be a full-time distributed worker and being a distributed worker comes with its own set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My truest challenge in this new lifestyle is knowing when it’s time to ignore Slack, shut off email, take off the Pebble, and just spend time with my family. It’s a challenge I’m learning to face, and the hardest part is admitting to myself that it’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s come up in conversation a couple times with my wife, and every time, she lets me know when I’m failing. Honesty here is the key. Not guilt, not anger, just brutal honesty of when I’m not being the best husband and dad because I’m putting work before them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges a distributed worker faces is figuring out the balance between work, family, and personal life. If you&amp;#8217;re struggling to find balance, I encourage you to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/the-mantra-of-family-comes-first&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; and the nearly 100 comments that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments are from people in similar positions trying to figure out how to balance work, life, and family. After nearly three years of being a distributed worker, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Bug in Chrome 45 Causes WordPress Admin Menu to Break</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48045</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-bug-in-chrome-45-causes-wordpress-admin-menu-to-break</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Within the last five weeks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33199&quot;&gt;several people have reported&lt;/a&gt; an issue in Chrome that breaks the WordPress admin menu. If you hover the mouse cursor over menu items in the sidebar, they&amp;#8217;ll occasionally fall out-of-place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-48046&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ChromeWPAdminMenu.png?resize=764%2C543&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome WordPress Admin Menu &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Using Chrome 45.0.2454.85, I&amp;#8217;m able to inconsistently reproduce the behaviour reported in the ticket. Through the process of elimination, users discovered Chrome is the software at fault and not WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179#c17&quot;&gt;source of the problem&lt;/a&gt; stems from Slimming Paint which is enabled by default in Chrome 45. Disabling slimming paint fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable this feature, visit &lt;strong&gt;chrome://flags/#disable-slimming-paint&lt;/strong&gt; in Chrome and &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Disable slimming paint&lt;/em&gt; option, and make sure the other two &lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt; options are disabled because they will override the Disable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds confusing, please refer to the following screenshot provided by Samuel Wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48056&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DisableSlimmingPaint.png?resize=839%2C185&quot; alt=&quot;Disable Slimming Paint Options&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Disable Slimming Paint Options
&lt;p&gt;Chrome&amp;#8217;s development team is &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=509179&amp;q=label%3AM-47%20slimming%20paint&amp;colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Cr%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified&quot;&gt;aware of the issue&lt;/a&gt; and is working towards a solution that is marked for release in Chrome 47. Until then, users are encouraged to disable Slimming Paint until Chrome fixes the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: A Dashboard Widget That Displays New Registered Users</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48037</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/a-dashboard-widget-that-displays-new-registered-users</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;If you run a WordPress site with user registration enabled and want to see recently registered accounts from the dashboard, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/new-user-dashboard/&quot;&gt;New User Dashboard Widget plugin&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/swadeshswain/&quot;&gt;Swadeshswain&lt;/a&gt;. After installing and activating the plugin, a new registered user widget appears on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-48038&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/NewUserDashboardWidget.png?resize=536%2C146&quot; alt=&quot;New Registered User Widget&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New Registered User Widget
&lt;p&gt;The widget tells you a user&amp;#8217;s registration date, name, and role. If you don&amp;#8217;t see the widget after activating the plugin, click on the Screen Options tab and make sure the box next to New User is checked. New User Dashboard Widget is the type of plugin that does one thing only and does it well. There&amp;#8217;s nothing to configure and it works out-of-the-box with WordPress 4.3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Proposal to Overhaul the Shortcode API in WordPress Goes Back to the Drawing Board</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48026</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/proposal-to-overhaul-the-shortcode-api-in-wordpress-goes-back-to-the-drawing-board</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/miqrogroove&quot;&gt;Robert Chapin&lt;/a&gt;, who contributes to WordPress core, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;published the first draft&lt;/a&gt; of a roadmap that explains how the Shortcode API could be overhauled. &amp;#8220;The decision to create this roadmap arose from specific needs that are not met by the old code,&amp;#8221; Chapin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has an aggressive timeline with development starting in WordPress 4.4 and ending in WordPress 4.7. In WordPress 4.4, a new syntax would be introduced that provides opportunities to make significant changes to the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of shortcodes that use the new syntax.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Self-Closing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode attr1=&amp;#8221;value1&amp;#8243; attr2=&amp;#8217;value2&amp;#8242; &amp;#8220;value3&amp;#8221; &amp;#8216;value4&amp;#8217; value5}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enclosing&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Enclosures&lt;/strong&gt;: [{{shortcode}$] HTML [${encl2}$] HTML [${encl3}$] HTML [${shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escaped Code&lt;/strong&gt;: [!{{shortcode}}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the WordPress 4.5 development cycle, the focus would be to deprecate the old syntax, &amp;#8220;Plugins that register shortcodes without declaring support for new features will raise debugging errors to alert developers that support for the old shortcode syntax is ending,&amp;#8221; Chapin said. Posts using the old syntax would  continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the WordPress 4.6 update process, shortcodes using the old syntax would be converted to use the new syntax. The Shortcode API would continue to provide deprecated support for the old syntax to provide a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important point to note is that the new syntax does not support HTML inside of shortcode attributes. This leaves the potential for many sites to break as shortcodes may not perform the same way prior to WordPress 4.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition process ends with WordPress 4.7 where support for the old syntax is eliminated. Shortcodes and plugins that use the old syntax would stop working. During the WordPress 4.7 update process, a second attempt would be made to upgrade old content to use the new syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Proposal Raises Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal has drawn constructive criticism from several members of the WordPress community. Nick Haskins, founder of Aesop Interactive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27426&quot;&gt;voiced his concern&lt;/a&gt; saying the syntax isn&amp;#8217;t easier for authors to use and will affect a large number of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://halfelf.org/&quot;&gt;Mika Epstein&lt;/a&gt;, who voluntarily moderates the WordPress.org support forums and interacts with users on a daily basis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27472&quot;&gt;sums up a list of concerns&lt;/a&gt; that many developers agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the plugins and themes on the planet we will break (because we will, they won’t read or test). We have to degrade them as gracefully as humanly possibly. Continuing to say “Well the developers were notified and should have updated” now that we’re as big as we are is not sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the very (legitimately) angry end users who are broken because they didn’t upgrade plugins and themes (or the themes/plugins didn’t get updated). People were rightly angry last time. It’s the end users, not the developers, who will be hardest hit by this change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating clearly to the users that it’s now &lt;code&gt;{{gallery}}&lt;/code&gt;. That’s going to be very hard. Incredibly hard. Updating their old posts (keeping in mind Justin’s Markdown caveat and those who use them as an aside – I know I know) is easier than making sure everyone knows what to do. At best we can keep tabs on the ones built into WP and perhaps use the logic we have in the visual editor NOW to convert them, but we have to figure out how to make sure everyone knows. This is nothing like the move of Menus to customizer. That was confusing, but the users could see what happened. This is a legit change, your old way is no longer going to work. That is huge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of users who have premium themes and plugins that &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; get update alerts. These people are simply not going to know they need to update and this is not their fault. We should never be breaking them if there’s possibly any alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users will be upgraded by their hosts vis-a-vis one-click installs and managed hosting so they will have up to date WP and out of date plugins/themes. So yes, many users will be on 4.7 and then a theme from 2014. It sucks, it’s the reality, we know it’s the reality, we cannot stick our heads in the sand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugins that are already using {{template}} tags in their code. Yeah, I’ve seen it. Most of them use it for search/replace within their own code, but we’ll want to make sure we check for everyone in the repo who might be doing it on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best argument against using the new shortcode syntax is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27518&quot;&gt;made by Stefano Agiletti.&lt;/a&gt; Agiletti says Italian keyboards don&amp;#8217;t have keys that create curly braces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe English people don’t know that { and } are not present in all keyboards directly as the [ and ] are. On Italian keyboards [ and ] are generated using ALT-GR+è or ALT-GR++ and keyboards show ALT-GR basic sign like €@## and [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get { and } you need to type ALT-GR+SHIFT+è and ALT-GR+SHIFT++. Most people don’t know about this combination (I think only those who write code do) and the parentheses are not written on any key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the Drawing Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a considerable amount of feedback and concerns shared by developers, the proposal is heading back to the drawing board. In a comment &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/#comment-27484&quot;&gt;summarizing the feedback&lt;/a&gt;, Andrew Nacin confirms that the new shortcode syntax does not fit the core team&amp;#8217;s vision of being easy and intuitive for non-technical authors to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he cautions that the team needs to do something, &amp;#8220;The proposed syntax significantly clashes with the proposed vision and given all of your feedback, we’re clearly going to have to go back to the drawing board. Please note that &lt;strong&gt;we still need to do something&lt;/strong&gt;, but maybe we can think further outside the box.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly encourage you to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/02/shortcode-roadmap-draft-one/&quot;&gt;proposal and the comments&lt;/a&gt; that follow it. It&amp;#8217;s a great read that highlights how difficult it will be to make changes to the Shortcode API that don&amp;#8217;t end up causing a lot of sites to break.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: The WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=48012</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who regularly comment on the Tavern may have noticed that your comments don&amp;#8217;t show up immediately after submitting them. That&amp;#8217;s because about four weeks ago, for the first time in the Tavern&amp;#8217;s history, comment moderation for all comments was enabled. I enabled moderation to address concerns raised by members of the community and to sleep better at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the request of a few readers and to be more transparent, I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/comment-policy&quot;&gt;comment moderation policy&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of at least a dozen people, I&amp;#8217;ve crafted a policy that is easy to read and more importantly, easy to follow. It explains our expectations, has a few tips on writing better comments, and lists possible reasons a comment may be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;&gt;CC0 licensed&lt;/a&gt; which is the least restrictive license offered by Creative Commons. Feel free to copy and modify it for your own use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;WP Tavern Comment Moderation Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strive to create a fun, friendly, and inviting atmosphere. The ground rules for commenting on WP Tavern are simple. Treat people the way you want to be treated. Try to understand someone else’s perspective and if you disagree, respectfully explain why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text is a difficult medium to decipher context. Emoticons and emoji help, but it doesn’t solve the problem. Take a deep breath and assume the commenter has the best of intentions before responding and approach discussions with open minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome different perspectives and viewpoints but we all need to clearly communicate them without tearing the opposition down in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay on point using concise language. If your comment is more than a few paragraphs long, consider publishing it on your own site instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your comment may be deleted if it matches any of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocates an illegal practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses vulgar, profane, or unnecessarily harsh language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is spam or appears to be written primarily to post a link or advertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is written anonymously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains copyrighted material not licensed for distribution on the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impersonates another user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains an affiliate link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal insults, including those using racist or sexist terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines are not meant to be an exhaustive list. The deletion of comments is wholly within the discretion of the moderators at WP Tavern and we will err on the side of maintaining a safe and friendly community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;font-headlines&quot;&gt;How Do I Report Comments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe a comment published on WP Tavern violates any of the listed guidelines or that you feel needs special attention, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wptavern.com/contact-me&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;. Please do not publicly report comments using social media such as Facebook or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Form submissions are sent to authors with comment moderation capabilities. Include a link to the comment in your email with a short explanation as to why it needs our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to reestablish the comment section as a place where people feel welcome to voice their opinions without the fear of being ripped apart. We encourage criticism, disagreements, and open conversation but it needs to take place in a respectful manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Post Status: A Day of REST — a conference devoted to the WordPress REST API</title>
	<guid>https://poststatus.com/?p=14173</guid>
	<link>https://poststatus.com/a-day-of-rest-a-conference-devoted-to-the-wordpress-rest-api/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;A Day of REST&lt;/a&gt; will be the first ever event dedicated to the WordPress REST API. It&amp;#8217;ll happen on January 28th 2016, with a follow-on hack day on the 29th, and will be held at Bishopsgate Institute in London, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is aimed at developers who want to learn how to interact with the new WordPress REST API. From WordPress developers to Javascript developers, to application developers, A Day of REST promises to provide in-depth information that covers every aspect of the WordPress REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of event I&amp;#8217;ve been hoping to see in the WordPress community. Sessions will vary from an introduction to the WordPress REST API to in-depth case studies and guides on utilizing it in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an incredible and rare opportunity to learn from the people making the API and those extending it further than anyone else. A niche event to be sure, A Day of REST  is a big bet on the WordPress REST API &amp;#8212; which is not yet slated for core, but is widely expected to make it to core in the next few releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference is being organized to supply a clear demand for more information, resources, and education on the subject. At most WordCamps, REST API sessions seem to be some of the most crowded, with the most engaged and curious audiences. A Day of REST will be like those sessions, but much bigger, as the entire day will be dedicated to the single topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is speaking at A Day of REST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14179&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/speakers-day-of-rest-752x603.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;speakers-day-of-rest&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker roster consists of people who are building the WordPress REST API, and those who are already using it for production applications and websites. The speakers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan McCue &amp;#8211;  WordPress REST API co-lead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe Hoyle &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Bachhuber &amp;#8211; WordPress REST API team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kathleen Vignos &amp;#8211; Director of Engineering, WIRED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K. Adam White &amp;#8211; Open Web Engineer, Bocoup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Lenox &amp;#8211; Design Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Taylor &amp;#8211; Senior Engineer, New York Times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nikolay Bachiyski &amp;#8211; Meta Engineer, Automattic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Post Status will be an official partner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really pleased that Post Status will be the official content partner for A Day of REST. That means I’ll be attending the event, and I&amp;#8217;ll offer a number of in-depth posts related to the WordPress REST API, the sessions, interviews, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll also manage content for some of the larger event announcements, like this one. I&amp;#8217;ve known the organizers for a long time, and they are big supporters of Post Status. A Day of REST offers a really great opportunity for me to work with them and offer my readers some unique privileges and exclusive content for a subject that&amp;#8217;s of interest to most of my audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So who is organizing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-14180&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/humans-752x333.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;humans&quot; width=&quot;752&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/organizations/human-made/&quot;&gt;Human Made&lt;/a&gt;, who’ve brought on board &lt;a href=&quot;http://siobhanmckeown.com/about/&quot;&gt;Siobhan McKeown&lt;/a&gt; to lead the charge putting the event together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Made uses the API in a good bit of their services and product work, are really interested to see more adoption of the API, and are eager to provide education resources so that can happen. Those of you who pay close attention may know that two of Human Made&amp;#8217;s own are actually part of the team of four that does much of the REST API development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rmccue&quot;&gt;Ryan McCue&lt;/a&gt; is the project co-lead, and is generally steering the ship; the API started as his GSoC (Google Summer of Code) project years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle&quot;&gt;Joe Hoyle&lt;/a&gt; is in day to day conversations for project direction and also commits a lot of code to the API; he is a co-founder of Human Made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hack Day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 29th January 2016, there will be a WordPress REST API hack day. This event is being hosted by Mozilla Spaces in London. Space for the hack day is limited but the team would love for anyone interested to come along and help make the WordPress REST API. Bring a laptop and expect to get hacking. This event will be for building the REST API specifically, and not geared toward other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ticket details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/tickets/&quot;&gt;from the website&lt;/a&gt;. They’re £125 (+ VAT &amp;amp; booking fees) &amp;#8212; which ends up being around $235 US &amp;#8212; and the price includes all of the usual conference goodies: presentations, lunch, swag, and an informal afterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confirmed sponsors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is excited to already have some awesome sponsors on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prospress.com/&quot;&gt;ProsPress&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityforms.com/&quot;&gt;Gravity Forms&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sucuri.net/&quot;&gt;Sucuri&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; Gold sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is also looking for more sponsors to get involved and help make this unique event happen. If you’d like to sponsor, send an email to events@humanmade.co.uk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the content, you can get updates either from this blog, or from the A Day of REST website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://feelingrestful.com/&quot;&gt;feelingrestful.com&lt;/a&gt;. You should also follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/feelingrestful&quot;&gt;@feelingrestful&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for live updates. I&amp;#8217;ll have in-depth content and broader event information and the event site will have more general announcements, news, and event updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is quite accessible from much of the world, so I am hopeful and confident that there will be a diverse audience in attendance. I certainly look forward to visiting; and I was pleasantly surprised that it doesn&amp;#8217;t get as cold there as I thought; January temperatures (lows and highs) stay around the 40s (F, or 5-9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_default&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;temperature_label_unit_c&quot;&gt;°&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; C) &amp;#8212; which is likely warmer than it&amp;#8217;ll be where I live in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Day of REST is an exciting development in the WordPress conference ecosystem and I&amp;#8217;m confident it&amp;#8217;s going to be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Envato Implements Item Support Policy for ThemeForest and CodeCanyon</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47990</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/envato-implements-item-support-policy-for-themeforest-and-codecanyon</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In August of 2014, Envato &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/news/item-support-sustainability-authors-clarity-buyers/&quot;&gt;announced a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; that would allow sellers on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codecanyon.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;CodeCanyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/?_ga=1.16356721.691392842.1429566039&quot;&gt;ThemeForest&lt;/a&gt; to inform buyers whether or not an item is supported. Earlier today, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketblog.envato.com/releases/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/&quot;&gt;Envato implemented&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;Item Support Policy&lt;/a&gt; for sellers on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When browsing items on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, a blue badge indicates the seller provides support. There&amp;#8217;s also a badge and text that informs potential buyers if an item is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47991&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SupportedBadge.png?resize=639%2C408&quot; alt=&quot;This Item is Supported&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This Item is Supported
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/page/item_support_policy&quot;&gt;the policy&lt;/a&gt;, buyers automatically receive six months of support from the date of purchase. If you need support for an entire year, you can buy an extension for a nominal upgrade fee. Envato takes 30% and gives 70% of the purchase to authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of a &lt;b&gt;6-month support extension&lt;/b&gt; for a &lt;b&gt;Regular License&lt;/b&gt; is calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37.5% of the item price (30% of the list price) when purchased at the same time as the license;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;62.5% of the item price (50% of the list price) when purchased during the support period; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87.5% of the item price (70% of the list price) when purchased after the support period has ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Freeman, product manager for Envato, says the changes provide a standardized definition of support, &amp;#8220;Buyers will know exactly what to expect from all purchases on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers who purchased supported items before the new policy went into effect have six months of free tech support starting on September 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disgruntled Authors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.envato.com/t/item-support-policy-and-functionality-launched/3619&quot;&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; with over 165 responses, sellers discussed the pros and cons of the policy while some expressed anger. &lt;a href=&quot;http://themeforest.net/user/jonathan01&quot;&gt;Jonathan Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cr3ativ.com/&quot;&gt;Cr3ativ&lt;/a&gt;, who sells several items on ThemeForest, thinks the policy is not as good as alternatives offered outside of the marketplaces because of its confusing complexity for both authors and buyers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure why Envato chose this solution when we already have a well established support/upgrade system in place within most of the WordPress community where 12 months of support is included in the purchase and customers receive a 50% discount to continue receiving support and updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is a work in progress, &amp;#8220;We will be monitoring the impacts of this change very closely and will be tweaking, improving and enhancing the support tools over coming weeks and months,&amp;#8221; Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a buyer or seller on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon, let us know what you think of the support policy in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Twenty Sixteen Now Available on GitHub and the WordPress Theme Directory</title>
	<guid>http://wptavern.com/?p=47973</guid>
	<link>http://wptavern.com/twenty-sixteen-now-available-on-github-and-the-wordpress-theme-directory</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty Sixteen, the default theme scheduled to ship with WordPress 4.4, is available for download on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/&quot;&gt;WordPress theme directory&lt;/a&gt;. According &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/29/twenty-sixteen-is-now-on-github/&quot;&gt;to Tammie Lister&lt;/a&gt;, Twenty Sixteen will be developed as if it were a feature plugin and will merge into WordPress core later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As development takes place on GitHub, changes will regularly sync up to the WordPress theme directory. By installing and activating Twenty Sixteen from the theme directory, users can easily update to new versions as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Twenty Sixteen has 23 issues and 27 pull requests on GitHub. Many of the issues such as, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/pull/23&quot;&gt;introducing automated Travis CI build testing into Twenty Sixteen,&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/labels/discussion&quot;&gt;up for discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the top half of the Tavern looks like with Twenty Sixteen activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47974&quot; src=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=1025%2C563&quot; alt=&quot;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Twenty Sixteen on the Tavern
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the content section looks like. Notice the block of code that displays instead of an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-47976&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TavernContentOnTwentySixteen.png?resize=881%2C648&quot; alt=&quot;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Content on the Tavern with Twenty Sixteen Activated
&lt;p&gt;Testers are encouraged to open issues and pull requests on GitHub. If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with how GitHub works, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; explains how to contribute to the Twenty Sixteen project. Keep in mind that Twenty Sixteen is a work in progress and should not be used in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Matt: Rigamortis Cover</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great jazz cover of one of my favorite Kendrick Lamar songs, Rigamortis, which of course is inspired by the great jazz song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=27&amp;v=TstRwZygLAo&quot;&gt;The Thorn by Willie Jones III&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
